"Mean-field modeling of the basal ganglia-thalamocortical system. I: Firing rates in healthy and parkinsonian states, S.J. van Albada, P.A. Robinson, 2009, JTB."

The system consists of the following populations: excitatory (e), inhibitory (i), reticular nuclei/TRN (r) and relay nuclei/SRN (s) forming the corticothalamic section, combined with the basal ganglia populations: D1, D2, GPi, GPe, STN.
