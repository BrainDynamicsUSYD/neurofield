NeuroField setup instructions (using Makefile)

Edit Makefile:
	1. Specify the configuration file in CONF (defaults to neurofield.conf)
	2. Identify the platform to run NeuroField, and comment/uncomment the appropriate COMP and CP directions

Edit the configuration file (as specified in Makefile)

Run 'make run' to compile and execute NeuroField to generate output files. In the case where output files are already present and no computation is needed, you will receive the message
	make: Nothing to be done for `run'.

To compile NeuroField without running, run 'make' to produce ./Release/NeuroField. A symlink to this binary will be created in the current directory.

'make clean' removes the entire 'Release' folder, so make sure you do not put any user data in there!
