NeuroField setup instructions (using Makefile)

Edit Makefile:
	1. Specify the configuration file in CONF (defaults to neurofield.conf)
	2. Identify the platform to run NeuroField, and comment/uncomment the appropriate COMP and CP directions

Edit the configuration file (as specified in Makefile)

Run 'make run' to compile and execute NeuroField to generate output files. In the case where output files are already present and no .cpp/.h/config files are changed, no computation will be needed, and 'make run' does nothing. To run NeuroField regardless of this, run './NeuroField' or './NeuroField -i configfile'.

To compile NeuroField without running, run 'make'.

'make clean' removes the entire 'Release' folder, so make sure you do not put any user data in there!
