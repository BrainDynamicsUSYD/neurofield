neurofield setup instructions

Run 'make'. A neurofield executable will be produced at ./Release/neurofield. A symlink to this binary will be created in the current directory

Use 'make run' to compile and execute neurofield, using the conf file specified in Makefile. This will only execute if the cpp files or if the conf file are changed

'make clean' removes the entire 'Release' folder, so make sure you do not put any user data in there!
