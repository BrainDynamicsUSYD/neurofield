NeuroField setup instructions

1. Edit Makefile:
	Identify the platform to run NeuroField, and comment/uncomment the appropriate COMP and CP directions.

2. To execute with only one set of parameters, edit your configuration file in Configs, then run './NeuroField Configs/config_file'. For example,
   ./NeuroField Configs/conf.emirs

3. To execute with varying parameters, edit your configuration file in Configs, then run './NeuroField Configs/config_file object_to_vary parameter_to_vary list of values' For example,
   ./NeuroField Configs/conf.emirs 'Propagator 1' gamma 10 20 30 40
   The output will be stored in Output/Parameter=Value directories.

4. To compile NeuroField without running, run 'make'.

5. 'make clean' removes the entire 'Release' folder, so make sure you do not put any user data in there!
