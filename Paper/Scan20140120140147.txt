Romesh, I've hacked your DESKTOP!! ^O^

NF capabilities: include state tracking?

Check wave propagator with Configs/wave.conf: make sure spatial dependency is
corect.

Include evoked response potential (ERP)?

Capabilities for cortical model?

Rewrite Burst code with generic RK4 algorithm (I'll do it)

"limitations" are "solved", hence no need for "limitation" section, rather
mention that conditions are checked and tools exist for calculation in
appropriate section.

Also, the fact that NF can very easily be extended, with generic RK4 solver
and Moore grid implemented.

NF can start from steady state or a desired initial condition.

Xuelong's epilepsy coupling?

Heading; Abstract

Intro:
	motivation for neural field theory
	Accomplishment of NFT of Robinson et al
	NF as simulation tool of Robinson NFT

Methods and Results
	NFT equations and objects
	NF: arbitrary pops and connections
		arbitrary types and parameter values
		easily extensible via development of new code

Examples
	in draft and above notes
	many example configs exist
