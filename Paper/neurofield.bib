The amplitude ratio between the situation with eyes closed and that with eyes open (EC/EO ratio) was calculated from quantitative parameters for each subject. The whole group was further divided into two subgroups according to age (younger than 60 and older 60 years). In the temporo-occipital bipolar derivations (T6-O2, T5-O1), a negative was found between alpha amplitude ratio and age in the whole group and especially in the subjects older than 60 years.},

abstract = {Converging findings from behavioral, neurophysiological, and neuroimaging studies suggest an integration-to-boundary mechanism governing decision formation and choice selection. This mechanism is supported by sequential sampling models of choice decisions, which can implement statistically optimal decision strategies for selecting between multiple alternative options on the basis of sensory evidence. This review focuses on recent developments in understanding the evidence boundary, an important component of decision-making raised by experimental findings and models. The article starts by reviewing the neurobiology of perceptual decisions and several influential sequential sampling models, in particular the drift-diffusion model, the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck model and the leaky-competing-accumulator model. In the second part, the article examines how the boundary may affect a model's dynamics and performance and to what extent it may improve a model's fits to experimental data. In the third part, the article examines recent findings that support the presence and site of boundaries in the brain. The article considers two questions: (1) whether the boundary is a spontaneous property of neural integrators, or is controlled by dedicated neural circuits; (2) if the boundary is variable, what could be the driving factors behind boundary changes? The review brings together studies using different experimental methods in seeking answers to these questions, highlights psychological and physiological factors that may be associated with the boundary and its changes, and further considers the evidence boundary as a generic mechanism to guide complex behavior.},

abstract = {Spindle oscillations (7-14 Hz) appear in the thalamus and cortex during early stages of sleep. They are generated by the combination of intrinsic properties and connectivity patterns of thalamic neurons and distributed to cortical territories by thalamocortical axons. The corticothalamic feedback is a major factor in producing coherent spatiotemporal maps of spindle oscillations in widespread thalamic territories. Here we have investigated the spatiotemporal patterns of spontaneously occurring and evoked spindles by means of multisite field potential and unit recordings in intact cortex and decorticated animals. We show that (1) spontaneous spindle oscillations are synchronized over large cortical areas during natural sleep and barbiturate anesthesia; (2) under barbiturate anesthesia, the cortical coherence is not disrupted by transection of intracortical synaptic linkages; (3) in intact cortex animals, spontaneously occurring barbiturate spindle sequences occur nearly simultaneously over widespread thalamic territories; (4) in the absence of cortex, the spontaneous spindle oscillations throughout the thalamus are less organized, but the local coherence (within 2-4 mm) is still maintained; and (5) spindling propagation is observed in intact cortex animals only when elicited by low intensity cortical stimulation, applied shortly before the initiation of a spontaneous spindle sequence; propagation velocities are between 1 and 3 mm/sec, measured in the anteroposterior axis of the thalamus; increasing the intensity of cortical stimulation triggers spindle oscillations, which start simultaneously in all leads. We propose that, in vivo, the coherence of spontaneous spindle oscillations in corticothalamic networks is attributable to the combined action of continuous background corticothalamic input initiating spindle sequences in several thalamic sites at the same time and divergent corticothalamic and intrathalamic connectivity.},

abstract = {The conductivity of the human skull was measured both in vitro and in vivo. The in vitro measurement was performed on a sample of fresh skull placed within a saline environment. For the in vivo measurement a small current was passed through the head by means of two electrodes placed on the scalp. The potential distribution thus generated on the scalp was measured in two subjects for two locations of the current injecting electrodes. Both methods revealed a skull conductivity of about 0.015 [symbol: see text]/m. For the conductivities of the brain, the skull and the scalp a ratio of 1:1/15:1 was found. This is consistent with some of the reports on conductivities found in the literature, but differs considerably from the ratio 1:1/80:1 commonly used in neural source localization. An explanation is provided for this discrepancy, indicating that the correct ratio is 1:1/15:1.},

abstract = {STUDY OBJECTIVES: The program provides a unique opportunity to compare a large number of scorers with varied levels of experience to determine sleep stage scoring agreement. The objective is to examine areas of disagreement to inform future revisions of the AASM Manual for the Scoring of Sleep and Associated Events. METHODS: The sample included 9 record fragments, 1,800 epochs and more than 3,200,000 scoring decisions. More than 2,500 scorers, most with 3 or more years of experience, participated. The analysis determined agreement with the score chosen by the majority of scorers. RESULTS: Sleep stage agreement averaged 82.6\%. Agreement was highest for stage R sleep with stages N2 and W approaching the same level. Scoring agreement for stage N3 sleep was 67.4\% and was lowest for stage N1 at 63.0\%. Scorers had particular difficulty with the last epoch of stage W before sleep onset, the first epoch of stage N2 after stage N1 and the first epoch of stage R after stage N2. Discrimination between stages N2 and N3 was particularly difficult for scorers. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that with current rules, inter-scorer agreement in a large group is approximately 83\%, a level similar to that reported for agreement between expert scorers. Agreement in the scoring of stages N1 and N3 sleep was low. Modifications to the scoring rules to improve scoring during sleep stage transitions may result in improvement.},

In this Symposium Review, we aim to demonstrate the ongoing impact of Hodgkin's and Huxley's ideas. The Hodgkin-Huxley model established a framework in which to describe the structural and functional properties of ion channels, including the mechanisms of ion permeation, selectivity, and gating. At a cellular level, the model is used to understand the conditions that control both the rate and timing of action potentials, essential for neural encoding of information. Finally, the Hodgkin-Huxley formalism is central to computational neuroscience to understand both neuronal integration and circuit level information processing, and how these mechanisms might have evolved to minimize energy cost.},

abstract = {With the introduction of bispectral index (BIS) as a measure of a patient's sedation during general anesthesia, attention has been directed toward bispectral analysis of electroencephalography (EEG). In the present study we evaluated the relationship between EEG bicoherence and sevoflurane concentration. Sixteen ASA physical status I-II patients scheduled for elective abdominal surgery were enrolled in the study. Anesthesia was induced with 5\% sevoflurane and maintained with sevoflurane and oxygen (50\%). Just before surgery, IV fentanyl (2 microg/kg) was given and then continuously infused (2 microg x kg(-1) x h(-1)). Using software we developed, EEG bicoherence, BIS, and 95\% spectral edge frequency (SEF95) were recorded at end-tidal sevoflurane concentrations of 0.5\%, 0.8\%, 1.1\%, 1.4\%, 1.7\%, 2.0\%, and 2.3\%. Under light anesthesia, EEG bicoherence values were low. With increasing sevoflurane concentrations, 2 peaks of bicoherence emerged along the diagonal line (f1 = f2). Both the first (at around 4 Hz) and second (at around 10 Hz) grew higher (37.7\% +/- 7.5\% and 35.1\% +/- 9.0\%, respectively) as the sevoflurane concentration increased to 1.4\%. However, the first peak leveled off whereas the second tended to decrease slightly with further increases in sevoflurane concentration. The BIS value decreased as the sevoflurane concentration increased and leveled off at 1.4\% and higher concentrations of sevoflurane. The SEF 95 also decreased as the sevoflurane concentration increased up to 2.3\%. Thus the distribution pattern of the two bicoherence peaks is likely to be better than BIS of the anesthetic effect of sevoflurane during surgery.},

abstract = {During normal sleep and anaesthesia the human EEG displays transient signals known as spindles: a 7 to 16 Hz oscillation which waxes and wanes over a period of approximately 1 s. Spindle detection is useful in quantifying depth of anaesthesia, but time consuming if done by human expert, hence a method of automatic spindle detection would be useful. In this thesis EEG ﬁles of patients undergoing propofol anaesthesia were used to derive spectrograms. We develop a method of adjusting the background noise of the EEG spectrogram to best reveal the time–frequency properties of the spindles present. Once this was achieved a number of selection criteria were obtained from a spindle data set in order to detect the spindles. The spindle detection algorithm was then applied to a data set of EEG ﬁles of patients undergoing propofol anaesthesia. The results were then compared with the time of loss of consciousness which had been recorded within the ﬁles. The spindle detection algorithm showed a clear increase in the number of spindles detected after loss of consciousness occurred. It was found that the time–frequency characteristics for spindles had two components. Acoherent component (possibly harmonic) and a noise component. The noise component had time–frequency characteristics that resembled the EEG background noise during transition from consciousness to unconsciousness, but at a much faster time scale.},

abstract = {Perceptual decisions are made when sensory evidence accumulated over time reaches a decision threshold. Because decisions are also guided by prior information, one important factor that is likely to shape how a decision is adaptively tuned to its context is the predictability of forthcoming events. However, little is known about the mechanisms underlying this contextual regulation of the perceptual decision-making process. Mathematical models of decision making predict two possible mechanisms supporting this regulation: an adjustment of the distance to the decision threshold, which leads to a change in the amount of accumulated evidence required to make a decision, or a gain control of the sensory evidence, leading to a change in the slope of the sensory evidence accumulation. Here, we show that predictability of the forthcoming event reduces the distance to the threshold of the decision. Then, combining model-driven fMRI and the framework of information theory, we show that the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) adjusts the distance to the decision threshold in proportion to the current amount of predictive information and that the dorsolateral cortex (DLPFC) codes the accumulation of sensory evidence. Moreover, the information flow from the ACC to the DLPFC region that accumulates sensory evidence increases when optimal adjustment of the distance to the threshold requires more complex computations, reflecting the increased weight of ACC's regulation signals in the decision process. Our results characterize the respective contributions of the ACC and the DLPFC to contextually optimized decision making.},

abstract = {The spatial statistics of scalp electroencephalogram (EEG) are usually presented as coherence in individual frequency bands. These coherences result both from correlations among neocortical sources and volume conduction through the tissues of the head. The scalp EEG is spatially low-pass filtered by the poorly conducting skull, introducing artificial correlation between the electrodes. A four concentric spheres (brain, CSF, skull, and scalp) model of the head and stochastic field theory are used here to derive an analytic estimate of the coherence at scalp electrodes due to volume conduction of uncorrelated source activity, predicting that electrodes within 10-12 cm can appear correlated. The surface Laplacian estimate of cortical surface potentials spatially bandpass filters the scalp potentials reducing this artificial coherence due to volume conduction. Examination of EEG data confirms that the coherence estimates from raw scalp potentials and Laplacians are sensitive to different spatial bandwidths and should be used in parallel in studies of neocortical dynamic function.},

abstract = {Sleep spindles are an electroencephalographic (EEG) hallmark of non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep and are believed to mediate many sleep-related functions, from memory consolidation to cortical development. Spindles differ in location, frequency, and association with slow waves, but whether this heterogeneity may reflect different physiological processes and potentially serve different functional roles remains unclear. Here we used a unique opportunity to record intracranial depth EEG and single-unit activity in multiple brain regions of neurosurgical patients to better characterize spindle activity in human sleep. We find that spindles occur across multiple neocortical regions, and less frequently also in the parahippocampal gyrus and hippocampus. Most spindles are spatially restricted to specific brain regions. In addition, spindle frequency is topographically organized with a sharp transition around the supplementary motor area between fast (13-15 Hz) centroparietal spindles often occurring with slow-wave up-states, and slow (9-12 Hz) frontal spindles occurring 200 ms later on average. Spindle variability across regions may reflect the underlying thalamocortical projections. We also find that during individual spindles, frequency decreases within and between regions. In addition, deeper NREM sleep is associated with a reduction in spindle occurrence and spindle frequency. Frequency changes between regions, during individual spindles, and across sleep may reflect the same phenomenon, the underlying level of thalamocortical hyperpolarization. Finally, during spindles neuronal firing rates are not consistently modulated, although some neurons exhibit phase-locked discharges. Overall, anatomical considerations can account well for regional spindle characteristics, while variable hyperpolarization levels can explain differences in spindle frequency.},

abstract = {Recordings in the locust antennal lobe (AL) reveal activity-dependent, stimulus-specific changes in projection neuron (PN) and local neuron response patterns over repeated odor trials. During the first few trials, PN response intensity decreases, while spike time precision increases, and coherent oscillations, absent at first, quickly emerge. We examined this "fast odor learning" with a realistic computational model of the AL. Activity-dependent facilitation of AL inhibitory synapses was sufficient to simulate physiological recordings of fast learning. In addition, in experiments with noisy inputs, a network including synaptic facilitation of both inhibition and excitation responded with reliable spatiotemporal patterns from trial to trial despite the noise. A network lacking fast plasticity, however, responded with patterns that varied across trials, reflecting the input variability. Thus, our study suggests that fast olfactory learning results from stimulus-specific, activity-dependent synaptic facilitation and may improve the signal-to-noise ratio for repeatedly encountered odor stimuli.

From a noninvasive EEG signal, this method produces physiologically meaningful pathways of the cortical state over a night of sleep. We propose ways in which these pathways offer insights into sleep-related conditions, functions, and complex pathologies. To address explicitly the noisiness of the EEG signal and the stochastic nature of the mathematical model, we use a probabilistic Bayesian framework to map each EEG epoch to a distribution of likelihoods over all model sleep states. We show that the mapping produced from human data robustly separates rapid eye movement sleep (REM) from slow wave sleep (SWS). A Hidden Markov Model (HMM) is incorporated to improve the path results using the prior knowledge that cortical physiology has temporal continuity.},

abstract = {Recent theoretical frameworks such as optimal feedback control suggest that feedback gains should modulate throughout a movement and be tuned to task demands. Here we measured the visuomotor feedback gain throughout the course of movements made to "near" or "far" targets in human subjects. The visuomotor gain showed a systematic modulation over the time course of the reach, with the gain peaking at the middle of the movement and dropping rapidly as the target is approached. This modulation depends primarily on the proportion of the movement remaining, rather than hand position, suggesting that the modulation is sensitive to task demands. Model-predictive control suggests that the gains should be continuously recomputed throughout a movement. To test this, we investigated whether feedback gains update when the task goal is altered during a movement, that is when the target of the reach jumped. We measured the visuomotor gain either simultaneously with the jump or 100 ms after the jump. The visuomotor gain nonspecifically reduced for all target jumps when measured synchronously with the jump. However, the visuomotor gain 100 ms later showed an appropriate modulation for the revised task goal by increasing for jumps that increased the distance to the target and reducing for jumps that decreased the distance. We conclude that visuomotor feedback gain shows a temporal evolution related to task demands and that this evolution can be flexibly recomputed within 100 ms to accommodate online modifications to task goals.},

abstract = {A fundamental feature of information processing in neocortex is the ability of individual neurons to adapt to changes in incoming stimuli. It is increasingly being understood that cortical adaptation is a phenomenon that requires network interactions. The fact that the structure of local networks depends critically on cortical layer raises the possibility that adaptation could induce specific effects in different layers. Here we show that brief exposure (300 ms) to a stimulus of fixed orientation modulates the strength of synchronization between individual neurons and local population activity in the gamma-band frequency (30-80 Hz) in macaque primary visual cortex (V1) and influences the ability of individual neurons to encode stimulus orientation. Using laminar probes, we found that although stimulus presentation elicits a large increase in the gamma synchronization of rhythmic neuronal activity in the input (granular) layers of V1, adaptation caused a pronounced increase in synchronization in the cortical output (supragranular) layers. The increase in gamma synchronization after adaptation was significantly correlated with an improvement in neuronal orientation discrimination performance only in the supragranular layers. Thus, synchronization between the spiking activity of individual neurons and their local population may enhance sensory coding to optimize network processing across laminar circuits.},

@article{Hill2012,
abstract = {Neuroimaging studies of human cognitive, sensory, and motor processes are usually based on noninvasive techniques such as electroencephalography (EEG), magnetoencephalography or functional magnetic-resonance imaging. These techniques have either inherently low temporal or low spatial resolution, and suffer from low signal-to-noise ratio and/or poor high-frequency sensitivity. Thus, they are suboptimal for exploring the short-lived spatio-temporal dynamics of many of the underlying brain processes. In contrast, the invasive technique of electrocorticography (ECoG) provides brain signals that have an exceptionally high signal-to-noise ratio, less susceptibility to artifacts than EEG, and a high spatial and temporal resolution (i.e., <1 cm/<1 millisecond, respectively). ECoG involves measurement of electrical brain signals using electrodes that are implanted subdurally on the surface of the brain. Recent studies have shown that ECoG amplitudes in certain frequency bands carry substantial information about task-related activity, such as motor execution and planning, auditory processing and visual-spatial attention. Most of this information is captured in the high gamma range (around 70-110 Hz). Thus, gamma activity has been proposed as a robust and general indicator of local cortical function. ECoG can also reveal functional connectivity and resolve finer task-related spatial-temporal dynamics, thereby advancing our understanding of large-scale cortical processes. It has especially proven useful for advancing brain-computer interfacing (BCI) technology for decoding a user's intentions to enhance or improve communication and control. Nevertheless, human ECoG data are often hard to obtain because of the risks and limitations of the invasive procedures involved, and the need to record within the constraints of clinical settings. Still, clinical monitoring to localize epileptic foci offers a unique and valuable opportunity to collect human ECoG data. We describe our methods for collecting recording ECoG, and demonstrate how to use these signals for important real-time applications such as clinical mapping and brain-computer interfacing. Our example uses the BCI2000 software platform and the SIGFRIED method, an application for real-time mapping of brain functions. This procedure yields information that clinicians can subsequently use to guide the complex and laborious process of functional mapping by electrical stimulation. PREREQUISITES AND PLANNING: Patients with drug-resistant partial epilepsy may be candidates for resective surgery of an epileptic focus to minimize the frequency of seizures. Prior to resection, the patients undergo monitoring using subdural electrodes for two purposes: first, to localize the epileptic focus, and second, to identify nearby critical brain areas (i.e., eloquent cortex) where resection could result in long-term functional deficits. To implant electrodes, a craniotomy is performed to open the skull. Then, electrode grids and/or strips are placed on the cortex, usually beneath the dura. A typical grid has a set of 8 x 8 platinum-iridium electrodes of 4 mm diameter (2.3 mm exposed surface) embedded in silicon with an inter-electrode distance of 1cm. A strip typically contains 4 or 6 such electrodes in a single line. The locations for these grids/strips are planned by a team of neurologists and neurosurgeons, and are based on previous EEG monitoring, on a structural MRI of the patient's brain, and on relevant factors of the patient's history. Continuous recording over a period of 5-12 days serves to localize epileptic foci, and electrical stimulation via the implanted electrodes allows clinicians to map eloquent cortex. At the end of the monitoring period, explantation of the electrodes and therapeutic resection are performed together in one procedure. In addition to its primary clinical purpose, invasive monitoring also provides a unique opportunity to acquire human ECoG data for neuroscientific research. The decision to include a prospective patient in the research is based on the planned location of their electrodes, on the patient's performance scores on neuropsychological assessments, and on their informed consent, which is predicated on their understanding that participation in research is optional and is not related to their treatment. As with all research involving human subjects, the research protocol must be approved by the hospital's institutional review board. The decision to perform individual experimental tasks is made day-by-day, and is contingent on the patient's endurance and willingness to participate. Some or all of the experiments may be prevented by problems with the clinical state of the patient, such as post-operative facial swelling, temporary aphasia, frequent seizures, post-ictal fatigue and confusion, and more general pain or discomfort. At the Epilepsy Monitoring Unit at Albany Medical Center in Albany, New York, clinical monitoring is implemented around the clock using a 192-channel Nihon-Kohden Neurofax monitoring system. Research recordings are made in collaboration with the Wadsworth Center of the New York State Department of Health in Albany. Signals from the ECoG electrodes are fed simultaneously to the research and the clinical systems via splitter connectors. To ensure that the clinical and research systems do not interfere with each other, the two systems typically use separate grounds. In fact, an epidural strip of electrodes is sometimes implanted to provide a ground for the clinical system. Whether research or clinical recording system, the grounding electrode is chosen to be distant from the predicted epileptic focus and from cortical areas of interest for the research. Our research system consists of eight synchronized 16-channel g.USBamp amplifier/digitizer units (g.tec, Graz, Austria). These were chosen because they are safety-rated and FDA-approved for invasive recordings, they have a very low noise-floor in the high-frequency range in which the signals of interest are found, and they come with an SDK that allows them to be integrated with custom-written research software. In order to capture the high-gamma signal accurately, we acquire signals at 1200Hz sampling rate-considerably higher than that of the typical EEG experiment or that of many clinical monitoring systems. A built-in low-pass filter automatically prevents aliasing of signals higher than the digitizer can capture. The patient's eye gaze is tracked using a monitor with a built-in Tobii T-60 eye-tracking system (Tobii Tech., Stockholm, Sweden). Additional accessories such as joystick, bluetooth Wiimote (Nintendo Co.), data-glove (5(th) Dimension Technologies), keyboard, microphone, headphones, or video camera are connected depending on the requirements of the particular experiment. Data collection, stimulus presentation, synchronization with the different input/output accessories, and real-time analysis and visualization are accomplished using our BCI2000 software. BCI2000 is a freely available general-purpose software system for real-time biosignal data acquisition, processing and feedback. It includes an array of pre-built modules that can be flexibly configured for many different purposes, and that can be extended by researchers' own code in C++, MATLAB or Python. BCI2000 consists of four modules that communicate with each other via a network-capable protocol: a Source module that handles the acquisition of brain signals from one of 19 different hardware systems from different manufacturers; a Signal Processing module that extracts relevant ECoG features and translates them into output signals; an Application module that delivers stimuli and feedback to the subject; and the Operator module that provides a graphical interface to the investigator. A number of different experiments may be conducted with any given patient. The priority of experiments will be determined by the location of the particular patient's electrodes. However, we usually begin our experimentation using the SIGFRIED (SIGnal modeling For Realtime Identification and Event Detection) mapping method, which detects and displays significant task-related activity in real time. The resulting functional map allows us to further tailor subsequent experimental protocols and may also prove as a useful starting point for traditional mapping by electrocortical stimulation (ECS). Although ECS mapping remains the gold standard for predicting the clinical outcome of resection, the process of ECS mapping is time consuming and also has other problems, such as after-discharges or seizures. Thus, a passive functional mapping technique may prove valuable in providing an initial estimate of the locus of eloquent cortex, which may then be confirmed and refined by ECS. The results from our passive SIGFRIED mapping technique have been shown to exhibit substantial concurrence with the results derived using ECS mapping. The protocol described in this paper establishes a general methodology for gathering human ECoG data, before proceeding to illustrate how experiments can be initiated using the BCI2000 software platform. Finally, as a specific example, we describe how to perform passive functional mapping using the BCI2000-based SIGFRIED system.},

abstract = {Interrater variability of sleep stage scorings has an essential impact not only on the reading of polysomnographic sleep studies (PSGs) for clinical trials but also on the evaluation of patients' sleep. With the introduction of a new standard for sleep stage scorings (AASM standard) there is a need for studies on interrater reliability (IRR). The SIESTA database resulting from an EU-funded project provides a large number of studies (n = 72; 56 healthy controls and 16 subjects with different sleep disorders, mean age +/- SD: 57.7 +/- 18.7, 34 females) for which scorings according to both standards (AASM and R\&K) were done. Differences in IRR were analysed at two levels: (1) based on quantitative sleep parameter by means of intraclass correlations; and (2) based on an epoch-by-epoch comparison by means of Cohen's kappa and Fleiss' kappa. The overall agreement was for the AASM standard 82.0\% (Cohen's kappa = 0.76) and for the R\&K standard 80.6\% (Cohen's kappa = 0.68). Agreements increased from R\&K to AASM for all sleep stages, except N2. The results of this study underline that the modification of the scoring rules improve IRR as a result of the integration of occipital, central and frontal leads on the one hand, but decline IRR on the other hand specifically for N2, due to the new rule that cortical arousals with or without concurrent increase in submental electromyogram are critical events for the end of N2.},

abstract = {A central difficulty of brain modelling is to span the range of spatio-temporal scales from synapses to the whole brain. This paper overviews results from a recent model of the generation of brain electrical activity that incorporates both basic microscopic neurophysiology and large-scale brain anatomy to predict brain electrical activity at scales from a few tenths of a millimetre to the whole brain. This model incorporates synaptic and dendritic dynamics, nonlinearity of the firing response, axonal propagation and corticocortical and corticothalamic pathways. Its relatively few parameters measure quantities such as synaptic strengths, corticothalamic delays, synaptic and dendritic time constants, and axonal ranges, and are all constrained by independent physiological measurements. It reproduces quantitative forms of electroencephalograms seen in various states of arousal, evoked response potentials, coherence functions, seizure dynamics and other phenomena. Fitting model predictions to experimental data enables underlying physiological parameters to be inferred, giving a new non-invasive window into brain function that complements slower, but finer-resolution, techniques such as fMRI. Because the parameters measure physiological quantities relating to multiple scales, and probe deep structures such as the thalamus, this will permit the testing of a range of hypotheses about vigilance, cognition, drug action and brain function. In addition, referencing to a standardized database of subjects adds strength and specificity to characterizations obtained.},

In this work, we present a 2.5-million-neuron model of the brain (called "Spaun") that bridges this gap by exhibiting many different behaviors. The model is presented only with visual image sequences, and it draws all of its responses with a physically modeled arm. Although simplified, the model captures many aspects of neuroanatomy, neurophysiology, and psychological behavior, which we demonstrate via eight diverse tasks.},

abstract = {The fundamental nature of the brain's electrical activities recorded as electroencephalogram (EEG) remains unknown. Linear stochastic models and spectral estimates are the most common methods for the analysis of EEG because of their robustness, simplicity of interpretation, and apparent association with rhythmic behavioral patterns in nature. In this paper, we extend the use of higher-order spectrum in order to indicate the hidden characteristics of EEG signals that simply do not arise from random processes. The higher-order spectrum is an extension Fourier spectrum that uses higher moments for spectral estimates. This essentially nullifies all Gaussian random effects, therefore, can reveal non-Gaussian and nonlinear characteristics in the complex patterns of EEG time series. The paper demonstrates the distinguishing features of bispectral analysis for chaotic systems, filtered noises, and normal background EEG activity. The bispectrum analysis detects nonlinear interactions; however, it does not quantify the coupling strength. The squared bicoherence in the nonredundant region has been estimated to demonstrate nonlinear coupling. The bicoherence values are minimal for white Gaussian noises (WGNs) and filtered noises. Higher bicoherence values in chaotic time series and normal background EEG activities are indicative of nonlinear coupling in these systems. The paper shows utility of bispectral methods as an analytical tool in understanding neural process underlying human EEG patterns.},

abstract = {The aim of this paper is twofold: first, to introduce a neural field model motivated by a well-known neural mass model; second, to show how one can estimate model parameters pertaining to spatial (anatomical) properties of neuronal sources based on EEG or LFP spectra using Bayesian inference. Specifically, we consider neural field models of cortical activity as generative models in the context of dynamic causal modeling (DCM). This paper considers the simplest case of a single cortical source modeled by the spatiotemporal dynamics of hidden neuronal states on a bounded cortical surface or manifold. We build this model using multiple layers, corresponding to cortical lamina in the real cortical manifold. These layers correspond to the populations considered in classical (Jansen and Rit) neural mass models. This allows us to formulate a neural field model that can be reduced to a neural mass model using appropriate constraints on its spatial parameters. In turn, this enables one to compare and contrast the predicted responses from equivalent neural field and mass models respectively. We pursue this using empirical LFP data from a single electrode to show that the parameters controlling the spatial dynamics of cortical activity can be recovered, using DCM, even in the absence of explicit spatial information in observed data.},

abstract = {Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that affects the whole basal ganglia (BG). Various techniques have been used to study BG physiology and pathophysiology. Among these, extracellular single unit recording remains of particular importance. An impressive number of studies of BG electrophysiological activity have been carried out, both in non-human and in human primates, but the data collected show many omissions and disparities. BG activity has been well defined in the physiological situation, but remains far from clear in the Parkinsonian and virtually unexplored in the dopamine (DA)-replacement situation. This paper provides a brief synopsis of (i) recording techniques and (ii) BG electrophysiological activity in normal, Parkinsonian, and dopamine-replacement situations. We have restricted the data used to those obtained in BG structures of human and non-human primates. Only single unit recordings have been reported and four electrophysiological characteristics retained: mean firing frequency, firing pattern, periodic oscillation, and response to both passive and active movement. We have attempted to summarize (i) the commonly accepted characteristics of each BG structure in the three situations, (ii) discrepancies that exist, and (iii) missing elements. Then, the main successive theories aimed to explain the role played by BG in motor control are presented and discussed in the light of the most recently obtained results using the latest technological advances.},

The contrast in these images depicts anatomical details of the brain by numerous dark lines of various sizes. These lines are absent in the image taken by the usual spin echo sequence. They represent the blood vessels in the image slice and appear when the deoxyhemoglobin content in the red cells increases. This contrast is most pronounced in an anoxy brain but not present in a brain with diamagnetic oxy or carbon monoxide hemoglobin. The local field induced by the magnetic susceptibility change in the blood due to the paramagnetic deoxyhemoglobin causes the intra voxel dephasing of the water signals of the blood and the surrounding tissue. This oxygenation-dependent contrast is appreciable in high field images with high spatial resolution.},

MUA and LFP responses were closely related, units discharging with high preference during LFP negativity. About 300 ms after flicker onset, responses stabilized and exhibited a highly regular oscillatory patterning that was surprisingly similar at different recording sites due to precise stimulus locking. Fourier transforms of these steady state oscillations showed maximal power at the inducing frequency and consistently revealed additional peaks at harmonic frequencies. The frequency-dependent amplitude changes of the fundamental and harmonic response components suggest that the retino-cortical system is entrainable into steady state oscillations over a broad frequency range and exhibits preferences for distinct frequencies in the theta- or slow alpha-range, and in the beta- and gamma-band. Concomitant activation of the mesencephalic reticular formation increased the ability of cortical cells to follow high frequency stimulation, and enhanced dramatically the amplitude of first- and second-order harmonics in the gamma-frequency range between 30 and 50 Hz. Cross-correlations computed between responses recorded simultaneously from different sites revealed pronounced synchronicity due to precise stimulus locking. These results suggest that the retino-cortical system contains broadly tuned, strongly damped oscillators which altogether exhibit at least three ranges of preferred frequencies, the relative expression of the preferences depending on the central state. These properties agree with the characteristics of oscillatory responses evoked by non-temporally modulated stimuli, and they indicate that neuronal responses along the retino-cortical transmission chain can become synchronized with precision in the millisecond range not only by intrinsic interactions, but also by temporally structured stimuli.},

abstract = {Numerous lesion, stimulation and recording studies in experimental animals demonstrate the importance of neurons within the preoptic/anterior hypothalamic area (POA) in the regulation of sleep induction and sleep maintenance. Recently, a discrete cluster of cells in the ventrolateral POA (vlPOA) of rats was found to exhibit elevated c-fos gene expression during sleep, indicating that these neurons are strongly activated during nonREM and/or REM sleep stages. We examined neuronal discharge during wakefulness and sleep throughout the dorsal to ventral extent of the lateral POA in rats, using chronic microwire technique. We found that neurons with elevated discharge rates during sleep, compared to waking, were localized to the vlPOA. As a group, vlPOA neurons displayed elevated discharge rates during both nonREM and REM sleep. Discharge of vlPOA neurons reflected the depth of sleep, i.e., discharge rates increased significantly from light to deep nonREM sleep. During recovery sleep following 12-14 h of sleep deprivation, vlPOA neurons displayed increased sleep-related discharge, compared to baseline sleep. Neurons in the vlPOA displaying increased neuronal discharge during sleep were located in the same area where neurons exhibit increased c-fos gene expression during sleep. Such neurons are likely components of a rostral hypothalamic mechanism that regulates sleep onset and sleep maintenance.},

It incorporates single-neuron physiology and the large-scale anatomy of corticocortical and corticothalamic pathways, including synaptic strengths, dendritic propagation, nonlinear firing responses, and axonal conduction. Small perturbations from steady states account for observed EEGs as functions of arousal. Evoked response potentials (ERPs), correlation, and coherence functions are also reproduced. Feedback via thalamic nuclei is critical in determining the forms of these quantities, the transition between sleep and waking, and stability against seizures. Many disorders correspond to significant changes in EEGs, which can potentially be quantified in terms of the underlying physiology using this theory. In the nonlinear regime, limit cycles are often seen, including a regime in which they have the characteristic petit mal 3 Hz spike-and-wave form.},

abstract = {Most psychological models of perceptual decision making are of the accumulation-to-threshold variety. The neural basis of accumulation in parietal and prefrontal cortex is therefore a topic of great interest in neuroscience. In contrast, threshold mechanisms have received less attention, and their neural basis has usually been sought in subcortical structures. Here I analyze a model of a decision threshold that can be implemented in the same cortical areas as evidence accumulators, and whose behavior bears on two open questions in decision neuroscience: (1) When ramping activity is observed in a brain region during decision making, does it reflect evidence accumulation? (2) Are changes in speed-accuracy tradeoffs and response biases more likely to be achieved by changes in thresholds, or in accumulation rates and starting points? The analysis suggests that task-modulated ramping activity, by itself, is weak evidence that a brain area mediates evidence accumulation as opposed to threshold readout; and that signs of modulated accumulation are as likely to indicate threshold adaptation as adaptation of starting points and accumulation rates. These conclusions imply that how thresholds are modeled can dramatically impact accumulator-based interpretations of this data.},

abstract = {In this study non-linear and linear global electroencephalogram (EEG) changes during a visual working memory task were studied using a separate analysis of theta, lower alpha and upper alpha band filtered data. EEGs were recorded in 21 healthy subjects (62.5 year; SD 2.1; 12 females, nine males) during an eyes-closed no-task condition and a working memory condition. Coarse-grained dimension was estimated for both conditions from spatially embedded EEG data filtered in the theta band and both alpha bands. Linear measures of coupling and mean amplitude were also computed. During the working memory condition lower alpha band dimension increased. Linear analysis showed alpha1 band desynchronization. Female subjects had a higher dimension in the theta band as well as more desynchronization in the theta and alpha1 band. Working memory capacity correlated with a lower theta band dimension during the no-task condition in female subjects. The increase in alpha1 band complexity can be interpreted as increased desynchronization corresponding with attentional processes. Higher complexity/desynchronization in females seems to be a more structural phenomenon and may be more intimately related to task performance.},

abstract = {The feedback excitation from the primary visual cortex to principal cells in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) is markedly enhanced with firing frequency. This property presumably reflects the ample short-term plasticity at the corticogeniculate synapse. The present study aims to explore corticogeniculate excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) evoked by brief trains of stimulation with whole-cell patch-clamp recordings in dLGN slices from DA-HAN rats. The EPSCs rapidly increased in amplitude with the first two or three impulses followed by a more gradual growth. A double exponential function with time constants 39 and 450 ms empirically described the growth for 5-25Hz trains. For lower train frequencies (down to 1Hz) a third component with time constant 4.8 s had to be included. The different time constants are suggested to represent fast and slow components of facilitation and augmentation. The time constant of the fast component changed with the extracellular calcium ion concentration as expected for a facilitation mechanism involving an endogenous calcium buffer that is more efficiently saturated with larger calcium influx. Concerning the function of the corticogeniculate feedback pathway, the different components of short-term plasticity interacted to increase EPSC amplitudes on a linear scale to firing frequency in the physiological range. This property makes the corticogeniculate synapse well suited to function as a neuronal amplifier that enhances the thalamic transfer of visual information to the cortex.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To explore the use of detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) scaling exponent of the awake electroencephalogram (EEG) as a new alternative biomarker of neurobehavioural impairment and sleepiness in obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). METHODS: Eight patients with moderate-severe OSA and nine non-OSA controls underwent a 40-h extended wakefulness challenge with resting awake EEG, neurobehavioural performance (driving simulator and psychomotor vigilance task) and subjective sleepiness recorded every 2-h. The DFA scaling exponent and power spectra of the EEG were calculated at each time point and their correlation with sleepiness and performance were quantified. RESULTS: DFA scaling exponent and power spectra biomarkers significantly correlated with simultaneously tested performance and self-rated sleepiness across the testing period in OSA patients and controls. Baseline (8am) DFA scaling exponent but not power spectra were markers of impaired simulated driving after 24-h extended wakefulness in OSA (r=0.738, p=0.037). OSA patients had a higher scaling exponent and delta power during wakefulness than controls. CONCLUSIONS: The DFA scaling exponent of the awake EEG performed as well as conventional power spectra as a marker of impaired performance and sleepiness resulting from sleep loss. SIGNIFICANCE: DFA may potentially identify patients at risk of neurobehavioural impairment and assess treatment effectiveness.},

abstract = {The properties of postsynaptic potentials evoked by stimulation of cortical, retinal and GABAergic thalamic afferents were examined in vitro in thalamocortical neurons of the guinea-pig dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus. Brief trains of stimulation (2-10 stimuli) delivered to corticothalamic fibers led to a frequency-dependent increase in excitatory postsynaptic potential amplitude associated with an increase in activation of both N-methyl-D-aspartate and non-N-methyl-D-aspartate glutamate receptors. In addition, repetitive stimulation of corticothalamic fibers also gave rise to a slow excitatory postsynaptic potential that was blocked by local application of the glutamate metabotropic receptor antagonist alpha-methyl-4-carboxyphenylglycine. In contrast, repetitive stimulation of optic tract fibers resulted in monosynaptic excitatory postsynaptic potentials that did not potentiate and were not followed by the generation of a slow excitatory postsynaptic potential. Repetitive activation of the optic radiation also evoked both GABA(A) and GABA(B) receptor-mediated inhibitory postsynaptic potentials. These inhibitory postsynaptic potentials exhibited frequency-dependent depression during repetitive activation. The presence of frequency-dependent facilitation of corticothalamic excitatory postsynaptic potentials and frequency-dependent decrement of inhibitory postsynaptic potentials, as well as the ability of corticothalamic fibers to activate glutamate metabotropic receptors, suggests that sustained activation of corticothalamic afferents in vivo may result in postsynaptic responses in thalamocortical cells that are initially dominated by GABAergic inhibitory postsynaptic potentials followed by prominent monosynaptic excitatory postsynaptic potentials as well as a slow depolarization of the membrane potential.Therefore, the corticothalamic system may inhibit or enhance the excitability and responsiveness of thalamocortical neurons, based both on the spatial and temporal features of thalamocortical interactions.},

abstract = {We present new findings that distinguish drift diffusion models (DDMs) from the linear ballistic accumulator (LBA) model as descriptions of human behavior in a two-alternative forced-choice reward maximization (Rmax) task. Previous comparisons have not considered Rmax tasks, and differences identified between the models' predictions have centered on practice effects. Unlike the parameter-free optimal performance curves of the pure DDM, the extended DDM and LBA predict families of curves depending on their additional parameters, and those of the LBA show significant differences from the DDMs, especially for poorly discriminable stimuli that incur high error rates. Moreover, fits to behavior reveal that the LBA and DDM provide different interpretations of behavior as stimulus discriminability increases. Trends for threshold setting (caution) in the DDMs are consistent between fits, while in the corresponding LBA fits, thresholds interact with distributions of starting points in a complex manner that depends upon parameter constraints. Our results suggest that reinterpretation of LBA parameters may be necessary in modeling the Rmax paradigm.},

Interneurones that elicited IPSPs were classified as classical fast spiking (n = 10), as non-classical fast spiking (n = 3, including one burst-firing interneurone), as unclassified, or slow interneurones (n = 8), or as regular spiking interneurones (n = 3), i.e. interneurones whose electrophysiological characteristics were indistinguishable from those of pyramidal cells. 3. All of the seven classical fast spiking cells anatomically fully recovered had aspiny, beaded dendrites. Their partially myelinated axons ramified extensively, varying widely in shape and extent, but randomly selected labelled axon terminals typically innervated somata and large calibre dendrites on electron microscopic examination. One 'autapse' was demonstrated. One presumptive regular spiking interneurone axon made four somatic and five dendritic connections with unlabelled targets. 4. Full anatomical reconstructions of labelled classical fast spiking interneurones and their postsynaptic pyramids (n = 5) demonstrated one to five boutons per connection. The two recorded IPSPs that were fully reconstructed morphologically (3 and 5 terminals) were, however, amongst the smallest recorded (< 0.4 mV). Some connections may therefore involve larger numbers of contacts. 5. Single axon IPSPs were between 0.2 and 3.5 mV in average amplitude at -55 to -60 mV. Extrapolated reversal potentials were between -70 and -82 mV. IPSP time course correlated with the type of presynaptic interneurone, but not with IPSP latency, amplitude, reversal potential, or sensitivity to current injected at the soma. 6. Classical fast spiking interneurones elicited the fastest IPSPs (width at half-amplitude 14.72 +/- 3.83 ms, n = 10) and unclassified, or slow interneurones the slowest (56.29 +/- 23.44 ms, n = 8). Regular spiking interneurone IPSPs had intermediate half-widths (27.3 +/- 3.68 ms, n = 3). 7. Increasingly brief presynaptic interspike intervals increased the peak amplitude of, but not the area under, the summed IPSP. Only at interspike intervals between 10 and 20 ms did IPSP integrals exhibit paired pulse facilitation. Paired pulse depression was apparent at < 10 and 20-60 ms. During longer spike trains, summing IPSPs decayed to a plateau potential that was relatively independent of firing rate (100-250 Hz). Thereafter, the voltage response could increase again. 8. Summed IPSPs elicited by two to fifteen presynaptic spike trains decayed as, or more rapidly than, single-spike IPSPs. Summed IPSPs elicited by > 20 spikes (> 150 Hz), however, resulted in an additional, more slowly decaying component (latency > 50 ms, duration > 200 ms). The possible involvement of GABAB receptors in this component is discussed. 9. It is suggested that three broad classes of interneurones may activate GABAA receptors on relatively proximal portions of neocortical pyramidal neurones. The different time courses of the IPSPs elicited by the three classes may reflect different types of postsynaptic receptor rather than dendritic location. An additional class, burst firing, spiny interneurones appear to activate GABAA receptors on more distal sites.},

abstract = {The GABAergic neurons of the nucleus reticularis thalami that control the communication between thalamus and cortex are interconnected not only through axo-dendritic synapses but also through gap junctions and dendro-dendritic synapses. It is still unknown whether these dendritic communication processes may be triggered both by the tonic and the T-type Ca(2+) channel-dependent high frequency burst firing of action potentials displayed by nucleus reticularis neurons during wakefulness and sleep, respectively. Indeed, while it is known that activation of T-type Ca(2+) channels actively propagates throughout the dendritic tree, it is still unclear whether tonic action potential firing can also invade the dendritic arborization. Here, using two-photon microscopy, we demonstrated that dendritic Ca(2+) responses following somatically evoked action potentials that mimic wake-related tonic firing are detected throughout the dendritic arborization. Calcium influx temporally summates to produce dendritic Ca(2+) accumulations that are linearly related to the duration of the action potential trains. Increasing the firing frequency facilitates Ca(2+) influx in the proximal but not in the distal dendritic compartments suggesting that the dendritic arborization acts as a low-pass filter in respect to the back-propagating action potentials. In the more distal compartment of the dendritic tree, T-type Ca(2+) channels play a crucial role in the action potential triggered Ca(2+) influx suggesting that this Ca(2+) influx may be controlled by slight changes in the local dendritic membrane potential that determine the T-type channels' availability. We conclude that by mediating Ca(2+) dynamic in the whole dendritic arborization, both tonic and burst firing of the nucleus reticularis thalami neurons might control their dendro-dendritic and electrical communications.},

abstract = {1. To compare the dynamics of synaptic transmission at different types of connection, dual intracellular recordings were made from pairs of neurones in slices of adult rat neocortex. Excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) were elicited by single spikes, spike pairs and brief spike trains in presynaptic pyramidal cells and responses recorded in postsynaptic pyramidal cells and in interneurones. 2. Pyramid-pyramid EPSPs were strongly voltage dependent and this resulted in a range of paired pulse effects. At thirty-two of sixty-nine pyramid-pyramid connections, the 2nd EPSP was the same shape as the 1st, indicating minimal interaction between active synapses. In these thirty-two connections, paired pulse depression (PPD) was apparent (2nd EPSP integral 46 +/- 21\% of the 1st, at 5-20 ms), which recovered within 60-70 ms. 3. In eleven additional pyramid-pyramid pairs, the 2nd EPSP was also the same shape as the 1st, but paired pulse facilitation (PPF, 149 +/- 32\%) decaying within 50-60 ms was apparent. Even these connections displayed frequency-dependent depression, however, as 3rd EPSPs were smaller than 1st EPSPs at intervals < 100 ms. 4. At twenty-five pyramid-pyramid connections, 2nd EPSPs were broader than 1st EPSPs and in sixteen of these, voltage- and NMDA receptor-dependent enhancement was large enough to obscure the underlying PPD. PPD was revealed by postsynaptic hyperpolarization (4 pairs), N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor blockade (3 paris), or if Mg2+ was removed (in the one case studied). If synapse location allowed significant depolarization of one active site by another, voltage-dependent enhancement could produce supralinear EPSP summation and overcome PPD. Third EPSPs were, however, consistently smaller than 1st EPSPs. 5. In striking contrast, profound frequency-dependent facilitation, independent of voltage or NMDA receptors was seen at fifteen connections involving two classes of postsynaptic interneurones. 6. At these pyramid-interneurone connections, facilitation of the 2nd EPSP (655 +/- 380\% at 5-20 ms) decayed rapidly, within 50-60 ms. Third and fourth EPSPs showed additional facilitation which decayed more slowly, within 90 ms and 2 s, respectively. Facilitation due to five to six spike trains was still apparent at 3 s. Therefore, once initiated by a brief high frequency spike train, facilitation was maintained at lower frequencies.},

abstract = {Two phenomena are commonly observed in decision-making. First, there is a speed-accuracy tradeoff (SAT) such that decisions are slower and more accurate when instructions emphasize accuracy over speed, and vice versa. Second, decision performance improves with practice, as a task is learnt. The SAT and learning effects have been explained under a well-established evidence-accumulation framework for decision-making, which suggests that evidence supporting each choice is accumulated over time, and a decision is committed to when the accumulated evidence reaches a decision boundary. This framework suggests that changing the decision boundary creates the tradeoff between decision speed and accuracy, while increasing the rate of accumulation leads to more accurate and faster decisions after learning. However, recent studies challenged the view that SAT and learning are associated with changes in distinct, single decision parameters. Further, the influence of speed-accuracy instructions over the course of learning remains largely unknown. Here, we used a hierarchical drift-diffusion model to examine the SAT during learning of a coherent motion discrimination task across multiple training sessions, and a transfer test session. The influence of speed-accuracy instructions was robust over training and generalized across untrained stimulus features. Emphasizing decision accuracy rather than speed was associated with increased boundary separation, drift rate and non-decision time at the beginning of training. However, after training, an emphasis on decision accuracy was only associated with increased boundary separation. In addition, faster and more accurate decisions after learning were due to a gradual decrease in boundary separation and an increase in drift rate. The results suggest that speed-accuracy instructions and learning differentially shape decision-making processes at different time scales.},

abstract = {To better understand population phenomena in thalamocortical neuronal ensembles, we have constructed a preliminary network model with 3,560 multicompartment neurons (containing soma, branching dendrites, and a portion of axon). Types of neurons included superficial pyramids (with regular spiking [RS] and fast rhythmic bursting [FRB] firing behaviors); RS spiny stellates; fast spiking (FS) interneurons, with basket-type and axoaxonic types of connectivity, and located in superficial and deep cortical layers; low threshold spiking (LTS) interneurons, which contacted principal cell dendrites; deep pyramids, which could have RS or intrinsic bursting (IB) firing behaviors, and endowed either with nontufted apical dendrites or with long tufted apical dendrites; thalamocortical relay (TCR) cells; and nucleus reticularis (nRT) cells. To the extent possible, both electrophysiology and synaptic connectivity were based on published data, although many arbitrary choices were necessary. In addition to synaptic connectivity (by AMPA/kainate, NMDA, and GABAA receptors), we also included electrical coupling between dendrites of interneurons, nRT cells, and TCR cells, and--in various combinations--electrical coupling between the proximal axons of certain cortical principal neurons. Our network model replicates several observed population phenomena, including 1) persistent gamma oscillations; 2) thalamocortical sleep spindles; 3) series of synchronized population bursts, resembling electrographic seizures; 4) isolated double population bursts with superimposed very fast oscillations (>100 Hz, "VFO"); 5) spike-wave, polyspike-wave, and fast runs (about 10 Hz). We show that epileptiform bursts, including double and multiple bursts, containing VFO occur in rat auditory cortex in vitro, in the presence of kainate, when both GABAA and GABAB receptors are blocked. Electrical coupling between axons appears necessary (as reported previously) for persistent gamma and additionally plays a role in the detailed shaping of epileptogenic events. The degree of recurrent synaptic excitation between spiny stellate cells, and their tendency to fire throughout multiple bursts, also appears critical in shaping epileptogenic events.},

abstract = {We hypothesized that individuals with untreated obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) would exhibit greater vulnerability to sleep deprivation than healthy controls, due to the additional neurobiological 'load' of chronic sleep fragmentation. After baseline sleep with 8 h time in bed, participants remained awake for 40 h. Psychomotor Vigilance Task (PVT, mean slowest 10\% 1/RT), AusEd Driving Simulator task (steering and speed deviation), and subjective sleepiness (Karolinska Sleepiness Scale, KSS) were assessed every 2 h. Nonlinear mixed-effects models were used to characterize individual differences in baseline/average performance, the linear effect of increasing hours awake, circadian amplitude and phase. Eight participants with untreated OSA with mean (SD) age 44.6 (8.4), apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) 49.8 (24.7), Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) 11.9 (4.8) and nine healthy controls age 27.8 (3.7), AHI 4.5 (2.7), ESS 7.3 (2.1) completed the protocol. Baseline KSS was significantly higher (1.4 units, P = 0.03) in the OSA group and there was a trend toward lower baseline speed deviation on the AusEd (P = 0.05). After adjusting for the significant effects of accumulated time awake, circadian amplitude and phase (all P < 0.005), there was no difference in performance decrements between those with and without sleep apnea in PVT, driving simulator performance and subjective sleepiness (P > 0.5). Random-effects modeling confirmed the presence of significant inter-individual variability in vulnerability to sleep deprivation. Patients with OSA did not respond differently to sleep deprivation than healthy controls. As expected, total sleep deprivation led to significant worsening in performance and subjective sleepiness in both groups.},

Although little is known about their function, two disparate perspectives have arisen to describe the activity patterns inherent to these diverse tree-like structures. Dendrites are thus considered either passive or active in their role in integrating synaptic inputs. This review follows the history of dendritic research from before the turn of the century to the present, with a primary focus on the hippocampus. A number of recent techniques, including high-speed fluorescence imaging and dendritic patch clamping, have provided new information and perspectives about the active properties of dendrites. The results support previous notions about the dendritic propagation of action potentials and also indicate which types of voltage-gated sodium and calcium channels are expressed and functionally active in dendrites. Possible roles for the active properties of dendrites in synaptic plasticity and integration are also discussed.},

abstract = {IMPORTANCE: Forward models predict the sensory consequences of planned actions and permit discrimination of self- and non-self-elicited sensation; their impairment in schizophrenia is implied by an abnormality in behavioral force-matching and the flawed agency judgments characteristic of positive symptoms, including auditory hallucinations and delusions of control.

OBJECTIVE: To assess attenuation of sensory processing by self-action in individuals with schizophrenia and its relation to current symptom severity.

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Functional magnetic resonance imaging data were acquired while medicated individuals with schizophrenia (n = 19) and matched controls (n = 19) performed a factorially designed sensorimotor task in which the occurrence and relative timing of action and sensation were manipulated. The study took place at the neuroimaging research unit at the Institute of Cognitive Neuroscience, University College London, and the Maudsley Hospital.

RESULTS: In controls, a region of secondary somatosensory cortex exhibited attenuated activation when sensation and action were synchronous compared with when the former occurred after an unexpected delay or alone. By contrast, reduced attenuation was observed in the schizophrenia group, suggesting that these individuals were unable to predict the sensory consequences of their own actions. Furthermore, failure to attenuate secondary somatosensory cortex processing was predicted by current hallucinatory severity.

CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Although comparably reduced attenuation has been reported in the verbal domain, this work implies that a more general physiologic deficit underlies positive symptoms of schizophrenia.},

abstract = {We examine theories of simple choice as a race among evidence accumulation processes. We focus on the class of deterministic race models, which assume that the effects of fluctuations in the parameters of the accumulation processes between-choice trials (between-choice noise) dominate the effects of fluctuations occurring while making a choice (within-choice noise) in behavioral data (i.e., response times and choices). The latter deterministic approximation, when combined with the assumption that accumulation is linear, leads to a class of models that can be readily applied to simple-choice behavior because they are computationally tractable. We develop a new and mathematically simple exemplar within the class of linear deterministic models, the Lognormal race (LNR). We then examine how the LNR, and another widely applied linear deterministic model, Brown and Heathcote's (2008) LBA, account for a range of benchmark simple-choice effects in lexical-decision task data reported by Wagenmakers et al. (2008). Our results indicate that the LNR provides an accurate description of this data. Although the LBA model provides a slightly better account, both models support similar psychological conclusions.},

abstract = {The sleep spindle rhythm of thalamic origin (7-14 Hz) displays widespread synchronization among thalamic nuclei and over most of the neocortex.1 The mechanisms which mediate such global synchrony are not yet well understood. Here, we theoretically address the hypothesis of Steriade and colleagues that the reticularis thalami nucleus may be considered as a genuine pacemaker for thalamocortical spindles.29-31 Interestingly, the reticularis consists of a population of neurons15,25 which are GABAergic and synaptically coupled.9,21,23,35 These cells, as do thalamic relay cells,10,17-18 exhibit a transient depolarization following release from sustained hyperpolarization.2,19,22,28 This postinhibitory rebound property is due to a T-type calcium ionic current which is inactivated at rest but de-inactivated by hyperpolarization. Theoretically, rebound-capable cells coupled by inhibition can generate rhythmic activity, although such oscillations are usually alternating (out-of-phase), rather than synchronous (in-phase).24 Here, we develop and apply to Steriade's pacemaker hypothesis our earlier finding34 that mutual inhibition can in fact synchronize cells, provided that the postsynaptic conductance decays sufficiently slowly. Indeed, postsynaptic receptors of the GABAB subtype mediate inhibition with a large decay timeconstant ([reverse congruent] 200 ms).13 In contrast, chloride-dependent, GABAA-mediated inhibitory postsynaptic potentials are fast and brief. Both GABAA and GABAB receptor binding sites are present in most thalamic regions, including the reticularis.4,6 We suggest that if GABAB receptors exist postsynaptically in the reticularis, they may play a critical role in the rhythmic synchronization among reticular neurons, hence in the thalamocortical system.},

abstract = {Being able to analyze and interpret signal coming from electroencephalogram (EEG) recording can be of high interest for many applications including medical diagnosis and Brain-Computer Interfaces. Indeed, human experts are today able to extract from this signal many hints related to physiological as well as cognitive states of the recorded subject and it would be very interesting to perform such task automatically but today no completely automatic system exists. In previous studies, we have compared human expertise and automatic processing tools, including artificial neural networks (ANN), to better understand the competences of each and determine which are the difficult aspects to integrate in a fully automatic system. In this paper, we bring more elements to that study in reporting the main results of a practical experiment which was carried out in an hospital for sleep pathology study. An EEG recording was studied and labeled by a human expert and an ANN. We describe here the characteristics of the experiment, both human and neuronal procedure of analysis, compare their performances and point out the main limitations which arise from this study.},

abstract = {The effects of depriving thalamic relay and intralaminar nuclei from their reticularis thalami (RE) inputs were investigated in acute and chronic experiments on cat. In acutely prepared animals, two (frontal and parasagittal) thalamic transections were made; extracellular and intracellular recordings were performed in RE-disconnected thalamic nuclei. In chronic experiments, the RE nuclear complex was lesioned by means of kainic acid injections; the activity of RE-deprived thalamocortical neurons was extracellularly studied during wakefulness and synchronized sleep. Two features distinguish RE-deprived nuclei from normal thalamic nuclei: absence of spindle-wave rhythmicity and all-burst activity of neurons. The abolition of spindle-related rhythms (sequences of 7- to 14-Hz waves recurring periodically with a rhythm of 0.1-0.2 Hz) in RE-disconnected thalamic nuclei and ipsilateral neocortical areas contrasted with normal spindling rhythmicity in contralateral EEG leads. Spontaneously occurring, rhythmic, long-lasting inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs), as observed in intact preparations, were no longer observed in RE-disconnected thalamic neurons. The remaining inhibitory events consisted of short-duration IPSPs. The possibility that RE nucleus is a pacemaker for spindling rhythms, imposing them through inhibitory projections to target thalamic areas, is supported by our concurrent experiments that indicate RE neurons preserve their rhythmicity after disconnection from their major (cortical and thalamic) input sources. RE-deprived thalamocortical neurons exclusively exhibit high-frequency spike bursts whose intrinsic structure is identical to that of intact thalamic relay cells. Instead of the spindle-related sequences of bursts seen in normal animals, the bursts of RE-disconnected thalamocortical neurons are single events, with a dramatic rhythmicity at 1-2 Hz. The presumed mechanism of this rhythmicity is the periodic activation of a low-threshold somatic conductance whose deinactivation is brought about by temporal integration of short-lasting IPSPs. It is known that high-frequency spike bursts of thalamic relay neurons result from hyperpolarization of cell membrane. We blocked the underlying inhibitory events by bicuculline and reversibly changed the all-burst activity of RE-disconnected neurons into a tonic mode. Since the only activity of RE-deprived thalamocortical neurons consists of burst discharges, we hypothesize that local-circuit GABAergic neurons are released from inhibition after RE disconnection or lesion.},

abstract = {The frequency tuning of a system can be directly determined by perturbing it and by observing the rate of the ensuing oscillations, the so called natural frequency. This approach is used, for example, in physics, in geology, and also when one tunes a musical instrument. In the present study, we employ transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to directly perturb a set of selected corticothalamic modules (Brodmann areas 19, 7, and 6) and high-density electroencephalogram to measure their natural frequency. TMS consistently evoked dominant alpha-band oscillations (8-12 Hz) in the occipital cortex, beta-band oscillations (13-20 Hz) in the parietal cortex, and fast beta/gamma-band oscillations (21-50 Hz) in the frontal cortex. Each cortical area tended to preserve its own natural frequency also when indirectly engaged by TMS through brain connections and when stimulated at different intensities, indicating that the observed oscillations reflect local physiological mechanisms. These findings were reproducible across individuals and represent the first direct characterization of the coarse electrophysiological properties of three associative areas of the human cerebral cortex. Most importantly, they indicate that, in healthy subjects, each corticothalamic module is normally tuned to oscillate at a characteristic rate. The natural frequency can be directly measured in virtually any area of the cerebral cortex and may represent a straightforward and flexible way to probe the state of human thalamocortical circuits at the patient's bedside.},

abstract = {Thalamic neurons, which play important roles in the genesis of rhythmic activities of the brain, show various bursting behaviors, particularly modulated by complex thalamocortical feedback via cortical neurons. As a first step to explore this complex neural system and focus on the effects of the feedback on the bursting behavior, a simple loop structure delayed in time and scaled by a coupling strength is added to a recent mean-field model of bursting neurons. Depending on the coupling strength and delay time, the modeled neurons show two distinct response patterns: one entrained to the unperturbed bursting frequency of the neurons and one entrained to the resonant frequency of the loop structure. Transitions between these two patterns are explored in the model's parameter space via extensive numerical simulations. It is found that at a fixed loop delay, there is a critical coupling strength at which the dominant response frequency switches from the unperturbed bursting frequency to the loop-induced one. Furthermore, alternating occurrence of these two response frequencies is observed when the delay varies at fixed coupling strength. The results demonstrate that bursting is coupled with feedback to yield new dynamics, which will provide insights into such effects in more complex neural systems.},

The signals between neurons and glia include ion fluxes, neurotransmitters, cell adhesion molecules, and specialized signaling molecules released from synaptic and nonsynaptic regions of the neuron. In contrast to the serial flow of information along chains of neurons, glia communicate with other glial cells through intracellular waves of calcium and via intercellular diffusion of chemical messengers. By releasing neurotransmitters and other extracellular signaling molecules, glia can affect neuronal excitability and synaptic transmission and perhaps coordinate activity across networks of neurons.},

abstract = {STUDY OBJECTIVE: To investigate differences between visual sleep scoring according to the classification developed by Rechtschaffen and Kales (R\&K, 1968) and scoring based on the new guidelines of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM, 2007). DESIGN: All-night polysomnographic recordings were scored visually according to the R\&K and AASM rules by experienced sleep scorers. Descriptive data analysis was used to compare the resulting sleep parameters. PARTICIPANTS: Healthy subjects and patients (38 females and 34 males) aged between 21 and 86 years. INTERVENTIONS: N/A. MEASUREMENT AND RESULTS: While sleep latency and REM latency, total sleep time, and sleep efficiency were not affected by the classification standard, the time (in minutes and in percent of total sleep time) spent in sleep stage 1 (S1/N1), stage 2 (S2/N2) and slow wave sleep (S3+S4/N3) differed significantly between the R\&K and the AASM classification. While light and deep sleep increased (S1 vs. N1 [+10.6 min, (+2.8\%)]: P<0.01; S3+S4 vs. N3 [+9.1 min (+2.4\%)]: P<0.01), stage 2 sleep decreased significantly according to AASM rules (S2 vs. N2 [-20.5 min, (-4.9\%)]: P<0.01). Moreover, wake after sleep onset was significantly prolonged by approximately 4 minutes (P<0.01) according to the AASM standard. Interestingly, the effects on stage REM were age-dependent (intercept at 20 years: -7.5 min; slope: 1.6 min for 10-year age increase). No effects of sex and diagnosis were observed. CONCLUSION: The study shows significant and age-dependent differences between sleep parameters derived from conventional visual sleep scorings on the basis of R\&K rules and those based on the new AASM rules. Thus, new normative data have to be established for the AASM standard.},

Almost all cortical neurons are produced during a limited embryonic period by cortical progenitor cells in a proliferative region that surrounds the ventricular system of the developing brain. The proliferative region comprises 2 distinct zones, the ventricular zone, which is a neuroepithelial layer directly adjacent to the ventricular lumen, and the subventricular zone, which is positioned superficial to the ventricular zone. Recent advances in molecular and cell biology have made possible the study of specific cell populations, and 2 cortical progenitor cell types, radial glial cells in the ventricular zone and intermediate progenitor cells in the subventricular zone, have been shown to generate neurons in the embryonic cerebral cortex. These findings have refined our understanding of cortical neurogenesis, with implications for understanding the causes of neurodevelopmental disorders and for their potential treatment.},

abstract = {An estimator of the total number of synapses in neocortex of human autopsy brains based on unbiased stereological principles is described. Each randomly chosen cerebral hemisphere was stratified into the four major neocortical regions. Uniform sampling with a varying sampling fraction in each region of neocortex was performed. The total volume of each neocortical region was estimated using point counting according to Cavalieri's principle. The ethanolic phosphotungstic acid staining technique was modified for synapses in human autopsy brains. The numerical density of synapses in each neocortical region studied was estimated using the disector at the electron microscopical level. The total number of neocortical synapses in each region was estimated as the product of the total volume of neocortex and the numerical density of synapses. The influence of the postmortem fixation delay on the number of synapses was investigated in five large mammals (one dog, one cow, and three pigs), the brains of which were kept under conditions similar to those under which human corpses are normally kept. The apparent decrease of 3.9\% in the numerical density of synapses in the large mammals following a 2-day fixation delay was not significant. The average total number of synapses in the neocortex of five young male brains was 164 x 10(12) (CV = 0.17). An analysis of the precision of the estimate of the total number of synapses in neocortex indicates that blocks represent both the major source of variation and the largest workload. Using eight blocks per brain the imprecision of the estimate is, however, only 66\% of the total variance.},

abstract = {Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behaviour disorder (RBD) is a parasomnia characterized by the intermittent loss of electromyographic atonia normally present during REM sleep and the emergence of purposeful complex motor activity associated with vivid dreams. Rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder usually affects older males and can be either idiopathic or symptomatic of various underlying disorders, in particular neurodegenerative diseases; in the latter case, RBD may be a prodromal symptom of the neurological disease. Several brainstem regions have been implicated in RBD pathophysiology, although the exact mechanism of the disorder in humans remains to be clarified. On clinical grounds, differentiation of RBD should be made from several non-REM parasomnias and other aberrant behaviours occurring during sleep. Rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder can be diagnosed on the basis of a systematic medical, neurological and psychiatric evaluation of the patient, assisted by a standard polysomnographic recording that includes continuous overnight videotaping; a brain imaging study is mandatory when an underlying brain disease is being suspected. Clonazepam at bedtime is the treatment of choice for RBD; alternatively, melatonin or pramipexole can be administered when clonazepam is contraindicated.},

abstract = {Sleep slow wave activity (SWA) is thought to reflect sleep need, increasing after wakefulness and decreasing after sleep. We showed recently that a learning task involving a circumscribed brain region produces a local increase in sleep SWA. We hypothesized that increases in cortical SWA reflect synaptic potentiation triggered by learning. To further investigate the link between synaptic plasticity and sleep, we asked whether a procedure leading to synaptic depression would cause instead a decrease in sleep SWA. We show here that if a subject's arm is immobilized during the day, motor performance deteriorates and both somatosensory and motor evoked potentials decrease over contralateral sensorimotor cortex, indicative of local synaptic depression. Notably, during subsequent sleep, SWA over the same cortical area is markedly reduced. Thus, cortical plasticity is linked to local sleep regulation without learning in the classical sense. Moreover, when synaptic strength is reduced, local sleep need is also reduced.},

The automatic analysis technique can be used on line or 32 times real time, allowing for the scoring of an 8 h sleep EEG record in 15 min. Therefore, the system has obvious potential for reducing the cost and increasing the efficiency of scoring EEG sleep records. Generally, the system has proven to be both accurate and reliable, giving satisfactory levels of agreement upon repeated scoring of the same record or upon scoring different records. The present study indicates further that frequency spectrum analysis is not practical in sleep staging, since the amplitude of delta activity and spindles changes throughout a given night. The incorporation of detectors of phenomena such as K complexes into the sleep-analyzing hybrid computer system will further increase its accuracy and reliability. However, linear analog filters, such as were used for spindle detection, are too sensitive to amplitude variations in the EEG. We have recently developed a non-linear spindle filter, which is not subject to this criticism. This filter will be the subject of a future communication.},

Here, we have used computer modeling and in vivo multisite recordings from the cortex and the thalamus in cats to examine the involvement of the cortex in spindle oscillations.

LFPs supplement action potential recordings by indexing activity relevant to EEG, magnetoencephalographic, and hemodynamic (fMRI) signals. Recent reports suggest that LFPs reflect activity within very small domains of several hundred micrometers. We examined this conclusion by comparing LFP, current source density (CSD), and multiunit activity (MUA) signals in macaque auditory cortex. Estimated by frequency tuning bandwidths, these signals' "listening areas" differ systematically with an order of MUA < CSD < LFP. Computational analyses confirm that observed LFPs receive local contributions. Direct measurements indicate passive spread of LFPs to sites more than a centimeter from their origins. These findings appear to be independent of the frequency content of the LFP. Our results challenge the idea that LFP recordings typically integrate over extremely circumscribed local domains. Rather, LFPs appear as a mixture of local potentials with "volume conducted" potentials from distant sites.},

abstract = {Electroencephalography (EEG) is the most specific method to define epileptogenic cortex. Its sensitivity and specificity depend on several factors such as age and recording procedures, for example, sleep recordings and activation procedures (hyperventilation, photic stimulation). EEG reveals characteristic findings in several epilepsy syndromes. Rarely, epileptiform discharges are recorded in healthy, particularly young individuals. Ictal video/EEG recording is considered to be critical in localizing the epileptogenic zone. A careful analysis of the first clinical signs and symptoms of a seizure and of the evolution of the seizure symptomatology can provide important localizing clues. Although surface EEG recordings are less sensitive than invasive studies, they provide the best overview and, therefore, the most efficient way to define the approximate localization of the epileptogenic zone. Invasive recordings are used in patients in whom the epileptogenic zone either cannot be located with noninvasive diagnostic methods or is adjacent to eloquent cortex. The most commonly used invasive electrodes are stereotactically implanted depth electrodes and subdural strip or grid electrodes. Foramen ovale and epidural electrodes are of intermediate invasiveness, but less sensitive. Invasive electrodes are subject to sampling errors if misplaced and should be used only after exhaustive noninvasive evaluations have (1) failed to localize the epileptogenic zone and (2) led to a testable hypothesis regarding this localization. Invasive EEG studies are associated with additional risks that are justifiable only if there is a good chance of obtaining essential localizing information and on a potentially resectable area.},

abstract = {The understanding of the structural and dynamic complexity of mammalian brains is greatly facilitated by computer simulations. We present here a detailed large-scale thalamocortical model based on experimental measures in several mammalian species. The model spans three anatomical scales. (i) It is based on global (white-matter) thalamocortical anatomy obtained by means of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) of a human brain. (ii) It includes multiple thalamic nuclei and six-layered cortical microcircuitry based on in vitro labeling and three-dimensional reconstruction of single neurons of cat visual cortex. (iii) It has 22 basic types of neurons with appropriate laminar distribution of their branching dendritic trees. The model simulates one million multicompartmental spiking neurons calibrated to reproduce known types of responses recorded in vitro in rats. It has almost half a billion synapses with appropriate receptor kinetics, short-term plasticity, and long-term dendritic spike-timing-dependent synaptic plasticity (dendritic STDP). The model exhibits behavioral regimes of normal brain activity that were not explicitly built-in but emerged spontaneously as the result of interactions among anatomical and dynamic processes. We describe spontaneous activity, sensitivity to changes in individual neurons, emergence of waves and rhythms, and functional connectivity on different scales.},

@article{McCormick1992,
abstract = {The mammalian thalamus forms an obligatory relay for nearly all sensory information that reaches the cerebral cortex. The transmission of sensory information by the thalamus varies in a state-dependent manner, such that during slow wave sleep or drowsiness thalamic responsiveness is markedly reduced, whereas during the waking, attentive state transmission is enhanced. Although activation of brainstem inputs to thalamic neurons has long been assumed to underlie this gating of sensory transfer through the thalamus, numerically the largest input to thalamic relay neurons derives from layer VI cells of the cerebral cortex. Here we report that activation of corticothalamic fibers causes a prolonged excitatory postsynaptic potential in guinea pig dorsal lateral geniculate relay neurons resulting from the reduction of a potassium conductance, consistent with the activation of glutamatergic "metabotropic" receptors. This slow depolarization can switch firing of thalamic neurons from the burst firing mode, which is prevalent during slow wave sleep, to the single spike mode, which is prevalent during waking, thereby facilitating transmission of sensory information through the thalamus. This prolonged enhancement of thalamic transfer may allow the cerebral cortex to gate or control selective fields of sensory inputs in a manner that facilitates arousal, attention, and cognition.},

@article{Zhang2013,
abstract = {Behavior is governed by rules that associate stimuli with responses and outcomes. Human and monkey studies have shown that rule-specific information is widely represented in the frontoparietal cortex. However, it is not known how establishing a rule under different contexts affects its neural representation. Here, we use event-related functional MRI (fMRI) and multivoxel pattern classification methods to investigate the human brain's mechanisms of establishing and maintaining rules for multiple perceptual decision tasks. Rules were either chosen by participants or specifically instructed to them, and the fMRI activation patterns representing rule-specific information were compared between these contexts. We show that frontoparietal regions differ in the properties of their rule representations during active maintenance before execution. First, rule-specific information maintained in the dorsolateral and medial frontal cortex depends on the context in which it was established (chosen vs specified). Second, rule representations maintained in the ventrolateral frontal and parietal cortex are independent of the context in which they were established. Furthermore, we found that the rule-specific coding maintained in anticipation of stimuli may change with execution of the rule: representations in context-independent regions remain invariant from maintenance to execution stages, whereas rule representations in context-dependent regions do not generalize to execution stage. The identification of distinct frontoparietal systems with context-independent and context-dependent task rule representations, and the distinction between anticipatory and executive rule representations, provide new insights into the functional architecture of goal-directed behavior.},

This paper seeks to automate the process of identifying alpha peaks and quantifying their frequency, amplitude and width as a function of position on the scalp. Experimental EEG was fitted with parameterized spectra spanning the alpha range, with results categorized by multi-site criteria into three distinct classes: no distinguishable alpha peak, a single alpha peak, and two alpha peaks. The technique avoids visual bias, integrates spatial information, and is automated. We show that multiple alpha peaks are a common feature of many spectra.},

Here we present evidence in humans that specifically implicates the thalamus in this interaction. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to measure brain activity during the performance of an attentional task under different levels of arousal. Activity evoked in the ventrolateral thalamus by the attentional task changed as a function of arousal. The highest level of attention-related thalamic activity is seen under conditions of low arousal (secondary to sleep deprivation) compared with high arousal (secondary to caffeine administration). Other brain regions were also active during the attentional task, but these areas did not change their activity as a function of arousal. Control experiments establish that this pattern of changes in thalamic activity cannot be accounted for by nonspecific effects of arousal on cerebral hemodynamics. We conclude that the thalamus is involved in mediating the interaction of attention and arousal in humans.},

Five variables (three statistical, two temporal) were extracted from each epoch. The first network computed an epoch by epoch classification, while the second network also utilized contextual information from contiguous epochs. A specific postprocessing procedure was developed to enhance the vigilance state discrimination of the neural networks designed and especially paradoxical sleep state estimation. The classifications made by the networks (with or without the postprocessing procedure) for six rats were compared to these made by two human experts using EMG and EEG informations on 63,000 epochs. High rates of agreement (> 90\%) between humans and neural networks classifications were obtained. In view of its development possibilities and its applicability to other signals, this method could prove of value in biomedical research.},

abstract = {Thalamic neurons generate high-frequency bursts of action potentials when a low-threshold (T-type) calcium current, located in soma and dendrites, becomes activated. Computational models were used to investigate the bursting properties of thalamic relay and reticular neurons. These two types of thalamic cells differ fundamentally in their ability to generate bursts following either excitatory or inhibitory events. Bursts generated with excitatory inputs in relay cells required a high degree of convergence from excitatory inputs, whereas moderate excitation drove burst discharges in reticular neurons from hyperpolarized levels. The opposite holds for inhibitory rebound bursts, which are more difficult to evoke in reticular neurons than in relay cells. The differences between the reticular neurons and thalamocortical neurons were due to different kinetics of the T-current, different electrotonic properties and different distribution patterns of the T-current in the two cell types. These properties enable the cortex to control the sensitivity of the thalamus to inputs and are also important for understanding states such as absence seizures.},

abstract = {In classical EEG analysis rhythms with different frequencies occurring at separable regions and states of the brain are analysed. Rhythms in different frequency bands have often been assumed to be independent and their occurrence was interpreted as a sign of different functional operations. Independence has scarcely been proved because of conceptual and computational difficulties. It is, on the other hand, probable that different rhythmic brain processes are coupled because of the broad recurrent connectivity among brain structures. We, therefore, set out to find interactions among rhythmic signals at different frequencies. We were particularly interested in interactions between lower frequency bands and gamma-activities (30-90 Hz), because the latter have been analysed in our laboratory in great detail and had properties suggesting their involvement in perceptual feature linking. Fast oscillations occurred synchronized in a stimulus-specific way in the visual cortex of cat and monkey. Their presence was often accompanied by lower frequency components at considerable power. Such multiple spectral peaks are known from many cortical and subcortical structures. Despite their well known occurrence, coupling among different frequencies has not been established, apart from harmonic components. For the present investigation we extended existing analytical tools to detect non-linear correlations among signal pairs at any frequency (including incommensurate ones). These methods were applied to multiple microelectrode recordings from visual cortical areas 17 and 18 of anesthetized cats and V1 of awake monkeys. In particular, we assessed non-linear correlations by means of higher order spectral analysis of multi-unit spike activities (MUA) and local slow wave field potentials (LFP, 1-120 Hz) recorded with microelectrodes. Non-linear correlations among signal components at different frequencies were investigated in the following steps. First, the frequency content of short (approximately 250 ms) sliding window signal epochs was analyzed for simultaneously occurring rhythms of significant power at different frequencies. This was done by a newly developed method derived from the trispectrum using separate averaging of the products of short-epoch power spectra for any possible combination of frequency pairs. Second, non-linear (quadratic) phase coupling between different frequencies was assessed by the methods of bispectrum and bicoherence. We found phase correlations at different frequencies in the visual cortex of the cat and monkey. These couplings were significant in about 60\% of the investigated MUA and LFP recordings, including several cases of coupling among incommensurate (i.e. non-harmonic) frequencies. Significant phase correlations were present: (1) within the gamma-frequency range; (2) between gamma- and low frequency ranges (1-30 Hz, including alpha- and beta-rhythms); and (3) within the low frequency range. Phase correlations depended, in most cases, on specific visual stimulation. We discuss the possible functional significance of phase correlations among high and low frequencies by including proposals from previous work about potential roles of single-frequency rhythms of the EEG. Our suggestions include: (1) visual feature linking across different temporal and spatial scales provided by coherent oscillations at high and low frequencies; (2) linking of visual cortical representations (high frequencies) to subcortical centers (low frequencies) like the thalamus and hippocampus; and (3) temporal segmentation of the sustained stream of incoming visual information into separate frames at different temporal resolutions in order to prevent perceptual smearing due to shifting retinal images. These proposals are, at present, merely speculative. However, they can, in principle, be proved by microelectrode recordings from trained behaving animals.},

abstract = {Mammalian sleep varies widely, ranging from frequent napping in rodents to consolidated blocks in primates and unihemispheric sleep in cetaceans. In humans, rats, mice and cats, sleep patterns are orchestrated by homeostatic and circadian drives to the sleepwake switch, but it is not known whether this system is ubiquitous among mammals. Here, changes of just two parameters in a recent quantitative model of this switch are shown to reproduce typical sleep patterns for 17 species across 7 orders. Furthermore, the parameter variations are found to be consistent with the assumptions that homeostatic production and clearance scale as brain volume and surface area, respectively. Modeling an additional inhibitory connection between sleep-active neuronal populations on opposite sides of the brain generates unihemispheric sleep, providing a testable hypothetical mechanism for this poorly understood phenomenon. Neuromodulation of this connection alone is shown to account for the ability of fur seals to transition between bihemispheric sleep on land and unihemispheric sleep in water. Determining what aspects of mammalian sleep patterns can be explained within a single framework, and are thus universal, is essential to understanding the evolution and function of mammalian sleep. This is the first demonstration of a single model reproducing sleep patterns for multiple different species. These wide-ranging findings suggest that the core physiological mechanisms controlling sleep are common to many mammalian orders, with slight evolutionary modifications accounting for interspecies differences.},

Here we investigate the extent to which these substantive conclusions depend on whether researchers use the Ratcliff diffusion model or the Linear Ballistic Accumulator model. Simulations show that the models agree on the effects of changes in the rate of information accumulation and changes in non-decision time, but that they disagree on the effects of changes in response caution. In fits to empirical data, however, the models tend to agree closely on the effects of an experimental manipulation of response caution. We discuss the implications of these conflicting results, concluding that real manipulations of caution map closely, but not perfectly to response caution in either model. Importantly, we conclude that inferences about psychological processes made from real data are unlikely to depend on the model that is used.},

abstract = {We have previously shown that local field potentials (LFPs) recorded in the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) and primary visual cortex (VCx) of the cat contain significantly more beta frequency activity when the animal attends to visual than to auditory stimuli. In the present study we utilised data from the same experiments to calculate the cross-correlation between envelopes of filtered beta (16-24 Hz) and gamma (30-45 Hz) oscillatory signals recorded at the same sites. Correlation values obtained from visual trials were significantly higher than those calculated for the auditory task. This observation was typical in those LGN and VCx recording sites which corresponded to the central representation of the visual field. The cross-correlation function peaked within a 20 ms time window from the centre of the cross-correlogram. These findings support the hypothesis that beta activity provides an excitatory background for the appearance of oscillations in the gamma band. (C) 1999 Lippincott Williams \& Wilkins, Inc.},

abstract = {Most neurons in the primary visual cortex initially respond vigorously when a preferred stimulus is presented, but adapt as stimulation continues. The functional consequences of adaptation are unclear. Typically a reduction of firing rate would reduce single neuron accuracy as less spikes are available for decoding, but it has been suggested that on the population level, adaptation increases coding accuracy. This question requires careful analysis as adaptation not only changes the firing rates of neurons, but also the neural variability and correlations between neurons, which affect coding accuracy as well. We calculate the coding accuracy using a computational model that implements two forms of adaptation: spike frequency adaptation and synaptic adaptation in the form of short-term synaptic plasticity. We find that the net effect of adaptation is subtle and heterogeneous. Depending on adaptation mechanism and test stimulus, adaptation can either increase or decrease coding accuracy. We discuss the neurophysiological and psychophysical implications of the findings and relate it to published experimental data.},

abstract = {Ample evidence supports a role for sleep in the offline consolidation of memory. However, circumstances exist where forgetting can be as critical as remembering, both in daily life and clinically. Using a directed forgetting paradigm, here, we investigate the impact of explicit cue instruction during learning, prior to sleep, on subsequent remembering and forgetting of memory, after sleep. We demonstrate that sleep, relative to time awake, can selectively ignore the facilitation of items previously cued to be forgotten, yet preferentially enhance recall for items cued to be remembered; indicative of specificity based on prior waking instruction. Moreover, the success of this differential remember/forget effect is strongly correlated with fast sleep spindles over the left superior parietal cortex. Furthermore, electroencephalography source analysis of these spindles revealed a repeating loop of current density between selective memory-related regions of the superior parietal, medial temporal, and right prefrontal cortices. These findings move beyond the classical notion of sleep universally strengthening information. Instead, they suggest a model in which sleep may be more ecologically attuned to instructions present during learning while awake, supporting both remembering and targeted forgetting of human memories.},

abstract = {Recording the activity of neurons is a mainstay of animal memory research, while human recordings are generally limited to the activity of large ensembles of cells. The relationship between ensemble activity and neural firing rate during declarative memory processes, however, remains unclear. We recorded neurons and local field poten- tials (LFPs) simultaneously from the same sites in the human hippocam- pus and entorhinal cortex (ERC) in patients with implanted intracranial electrodes during a virtual taxi-driver task that also included a memory retrieval component. Neurons increased their firing rate in response to specific passengers or landmarks both during navigation and retrieval. Although we did not find item specificity in the broadband LFP, both h- and c-band LFPs increased power to specific items on a small but sig- nificant percent of channels. These responses, however, did not corre- late with item-specific neural responses. To contrast item-specific responses with process-specific responses during memory, we compared neural and LFP responses during encoding (navigation) and retrieval (associative and item-specific recognition). A subset of neurons also altered firing rates nonspecifically while subjects viewed items during encoding. Interestingly, LFPs in the hippocampus and ERC increased in power nonspecifically while subjects viewed items during retrieval, more often during associative than item-recognition. Furthermore, we found no correlation between neural firing rate and broadband, h-band, and c-band LFPs during process-specific responses. Our findings suggest that neuronal firing and ensemble activity can be dissociated during encoding, item-maintenance, and retrieval in the human hippocampal area, likely relating to functional properties unique to this region.},

To address this deficit, we explored the relationship between ordinary stimulus-controlled pattern perception and the autonomous hallucinatory geometrical pattern formation that occurs for unstructured visual stimulation (e.g., empty-field flicker). We found that flicker-induced hallucinations are biased by the presentation of adjacent geometrical stimuli; geometrical forms that map to cortical area V1 as orthogonal gratings are perceptually opponent in biasing hallucinations. Rotating fan blades and pulsating circular patterns are the most salient biased hallucinations. Apparent motion and fractal (1/f) noise are also effective in driving hallucinatory pattern formation (the latter is consistent with predictions of spatiotemporal pattern formation driven by stochastic resonance). The behavior of these percepts suggests that self-organized hallucinatory pattern formation in human vision is governed by the same cortical properties of localized processing, lateral inhibition, simultaneous contrast, and nonlinear retinotopic mapping that govern ordinary vision.},

Using simultaneous intracortical and intrathalamic recordings, we demonstrate here that the thalamic deactivation occurring at sleep onset most often precedes that of the cortex by several minutes, whereas reactivation of both structures during awakening is synchronized. Delays between thalamus and cortex deactivations can vary from one subject to another when a similar cortical region is considered. In addition, heterogeneity in activity levels throughout the cortical mantle is larger than previously thought during the descent into sleep. Thus, asynchronous thalamo-cortical deactivation while falling asleep probably explains the production of hypnagogic hallucinations by a still-activated cortex and the common self-overestimation of the time needed to fall asleep.},

abstract = {Unihemispheric sleep has been observed in numerous species, including birds and aquatic mammals. While knowledge of its functional role has been improved in recent years, the physiological mechanisms that generate this behavior remain poorly understood. Here, unihemispheric sleep is simulated using a physiologically based quantitative model of the mammalian ascending arousal system. The model includes mutual inhibition between wake-promoting monoaminergic nuclei (MA) and sleep-promoting ventrolateral preoptic nuclei (VLPO), driven by circadian and homeostatic drives as well as cholinergic and orexinergic input to MA. The model is extended here to incorporate two distinct hemispheres and their interconnections. It is postulated that inhibitory connections between VLPO nuclei in opposite hemispheres are responsible for unihemispheric sleep, and it is shown that contralateral inhibitory connections promote unihemispheric sleep while ipsilateral inhibitory connections promote bihemispheric sleep. The frequency of alternating unihemispheric sleep bouts is chiefly determined by sleep homeostasis and its corresponding time constant. It is shown that the model reproduces dolphin sleep, and that the sleep regimes of humans, cetaceans, and fur seals, the latter both terrestrially and in a marine environment, require only modest changes in contralateral connection strength and homeostatic time constant. It is further demonstrated that fur seals can potentially switch between their terrestrial bihemispheric and aquatic unihemispheric sleep patterns by varying just the contralateral connection strength. These results provide experimentally testable predictions regarding the differences between species that sleep bihemispherically and unihemispherically.},

abstract = {Purpose: The occurrence of abnormal dynamics in a physiological system can become manifest as a sudden qualitative change in the behavior of characteristic physiologic variables. We assume that this is what happens in the brain with regard to epilepsy. We consider that neuronal networks involved in epilepsy possess multistable dynamics (i.e., they may display several dynamic states). To illustrate this concept, we may assume, for simplicity, that at least two states are possible: an interictal one characterized by a normal, apparently random, steady -state of ongoing activity, and another one that is characterized by the paroxysmal occurrence of a synchronous oscillations (seizure). Methods: By using the terminology of the mathematics of nonlinear systems, we can say that such a bistable system has two attractors, to which the trajectories describing the system's output converge, depending on initial conditions and on the system's parameters. In phase-space, the basins of attraction corresponding to the two states are separated by what is called a "separatrix." We propose, schematically, that the transition between the normal ongoing and the seizure activity can take place according to three basic models: Model I: In certain epileptic brains (e.g., in absence seizures of idiopathic primary generalized epilepsies), the distance between "normal steady -state" and "paroxysmal" attractors is very small in contrast to that of a normal brain (possibly due to genetic and/or developmental factors). In the former, discrete random fluctuations of some variables can be sufficient for the occurrence of a transition to the paroxysmal state. In this case, such seizures are not predictable. Model II and model III: In other kinds of epileptic brains (e.g., limbic cortex epilepsies), the distance between "normal steady-state" and "paroxysmal" attractors is, in general, rather large, such that random fluctuations, of themselves, are commonly not capable of triggering a seizure. However, in these brains, neuronal networks have abnormal features characterized by unstable parameters that are very vulnerable to the influence of endogenous (model II) and/or exogenous (model III) factors. In these cases, these critical parameters may gradually change with time, in such a way that the attractor can deform either gradually or suddenly, with the consequence that the distance between the basin of attraction of the normal state and the separatrix tends to zero. This can lead, eventually, to a transition to a seizure. Results: The changes of the system's dynamics preceding a seizure in these models either may be detectable in the EEG and thus the route to the seizure may be predictable, or may be unobservable by using only measurements of the dynamical state. It is thinkable, however, that in some cases, changes in the excitability state of the underlying networks may be uncovered by using appropriate stimuli configurations before changes in the dynamics of the ongoing EEG activity are evident. A typical example of model III that we discuss here is photosensitive epilepsy. Conclusions: We present an overview of these basic models, based on neurophysiologic recordings combined with signal analysis and on simulations performed by using computational models of neuronal networks. We pay especial attention to recent model studies and to novel experimental results obtained while analyzing EEG features preceding limbic seizures and during intermittent photic stimulation that precedes the transition to paroxysmal epileptic activity.},
annote = {This paper looks at a nonlinear model for seizures in terms of a bifurcation between stable and unstable states characterised by the distance between attractors to each state. That is, it considers that the system has unstable and stable attractors, and whether the brain is susceptible to seizures depends on the distance between these attractors (and the location of the separatrix between the two)This work only considers 'petit mal' or absence seizures involving a 3Hz mode. They also consider the case where changes in the dynamics of the system cause the attractors to move closer together.They also used phase coherence measurements to provide a probabalistic model of photosensitive seizures on the order of seconds before the event- the frequencies examined were harmonics of the input light. It appears that this paper is not intended to make conclusions in and of itself- the idea seems to be to persuade biologists that nonlinear dynamics are required to understand epilepsy. The simple model looks at how a bifurcation can explain the difference between seizures and normal activity, and also how the positioning of the separatrix can influence this. It then goes on to discuss, but not implement, features such as time-varying connections which would cause the separatrix to move etc. and proposes these as extensions.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: This study characterises and describes the maturational evolution of the healthy infant sleep electroencephalogram (EEG) longitudinally from 2 weeks to 24 months of age, by means of power spectral analysis. METHODS: A prospective cohort of 34 healthy infants underwent overnight polysomnography (PSG) at 2 weeks, and at 3, 6, 12 and 24 months of age. Sleep epochs were scored as Active Sleep (AS) and Quiet Sleep (QS) at 2 weeks of age and as Rapid Eye Movement (REM) and Non-REM (NREM) stages from 3 months onwards. Representative epochs were used to generate the EEG power spectra, from the central C3 derivation. These were analysed visually and quantitatively in AS/REM and QS/NREM sleep in the following bandwidths: delta (0.5-4 Hz); theta (4-8 Hz); alpha (8-11 Hz); sigma (11-15 Hz) and 0.5-25 Hz. RESULTS: Sleep EEG (central derivation) power spectra changed significantly in the different bandwidths as the infants matured. The emergence of a peak in the sigma bandwidth in NREM N2 sleep corresponded with the development of sleep spindles. Maturational changes were also seen in NREM N3 and in theta and alpha bandwidths in both AS/REM and QS/NREM. CONCLUSIONS: Sleep EEG power spectra characteristics in healthy infants evolve in keeping with maturation and neurodevelopmental milestones. SIGNIFICANCE: This study provides an atlas of healthy infant sleep EEG in the early years of life, providing a basis for association with other neurodevelopmental measures and a normative dataset on which disease may be discriminated.},

Sleep stages and sustained fluctuations of autonomic functions such as temperature, blood pressure, electroencephalogram (EEG), etc., can be described as a chaotic process. The EEG signals are highly subjective and the information about the various states may appear at random in the time scale. Therefore, EEG signal parameters, extracted and analyzed using computers, are highly useful in diagnostics. The sleep data analysis is carried out using non-linear parameters: correlation dimension, fractal dimension, largest Lyapunov entropy, approximate entropy, Hurst exponent, phase space plot and recurrence plots. These non-linear parameters quantify the cortical function at different sleep stages and the results are tabulated.},

@article{Acerbi2014,
abstract = {Humans have been shown to combine noisy sensory information with previous experience (priors), in qualitative and sometimes quantitative agreement with the statistically-optimal predictions of Bayesian integration. However, when the prior distribution becomes more complex than a simple Gaussian, such as skewed or bimodal, training takes much longer and performance appears suboptimal. It is unclear whether such suboptimality arises from an imprecise internal representation of the complex prior, or from additional constraints in performing probabilistic computations on complex distributions, even when accurately represented. Here we probe the sources of suboptimality in probabilistic inference using a novel estimation task in which subjects are exposed to an explicitly provided distribution, thereby removing the need to remember the prior. Subjects had to estimate the location of a target given a noisy cue and a visual representation of the prior probability density over locations, which changed on each trial. Different classes of priors were examined (Gaussian, unimodal, bimodal). Subjects' performance was in qualitative agreement with the predictions of Bayesian Decision Theory although generally suboptimal. The degree of suboptimality was modulated by statistical features of the priors but was largely independent of the class of the prior and level of noise in the cue, suggesting that suboptimality in dealing with complex statistical features, such as bimodality, may be due to a problem of acquiring the priors rather than computing with them. We performed a factorial model comparison across a large set of Bayesian observer models to identify additional sources of noise and suboptimality. Our analysis rejects several models of stochastic behavior, including probability matching and sample-averaging strategies. Instead we show that subjects' response variability was mainly driven by a combination of a noisy estimation of the parameters of the priors, and by variability in the decision process, which we represent as a noisy or stochastic posterior.},

Impaired decision-making is a symptomatic feature of a number of neurodegenerative diseases, but the nature of these decision-making deficits depends on the particular disease. Thus, examining the qualitative differences in decision-making impairments associated with different neurodegenerative diseases could provide valuable information regarding the underlying neural basis of decision-making. Nevertheless, few comparative reports of decision-making across patient groups exist. In this Review, we examine the neuroanatomical substrates of decision-making in relation to the neuropathological changes that occur in Alzheimer disease, frontotemporal dementia, Parkinson disease and Huntington disease. We then examine the main findings from studies of decision-making in these neurodegenerative diseases. Finally, we suggest a number of recommendations that future studies could adopt to aid our understanding of decision-making cognition.},

abstract = {Summary The need to sleep grows with the duration of wakefulness and dissipates with time spent asleep, a process called sleep homeostasis. What are the consequences of staying awake on brain cells, and why is sleep needed? Surprisingly, we do not know whether the firing of cortical neurons is affected by how long an animal has been awake or asleep. Here, we found that after sustained wakefulness cortical neurons fire at higher frequencies in all behavioral states. During early NREM sleep after sustained wakefulness, periods of population activity (ON) are short, frequent, and associated with synchronous firing, while periods of neuronal silence are long and frequent. After sustained sleep, firing rates and synchrony decrease, while the duration of ON periods increases. Changes in firing patterns in NREM sleep correlate with changes in slow-wave activity, a marker of sleep homeostasis. Thus, the systematic increase of firing during wakefulness is counterbalanced by staying asleep.},

A realistic geometry inhomogeneous head model including the implanted silastic grids was constructed with the aid of the finite element method, and used to estimate the conductivity ratio. Averaging over 49 sets of measurements, the mean value and standard deviation of the brain-to-skull conductivity ratio were found to be 18.7 and 2.1, respectively.},

abstract = {Previous electrophysiological studies have demonstrated interactions between dichoptic visual stimuli presented to the same location in visual space. In this study, we used non-liner spectral analysis, in particular the bispectrum, to study interactions between the electrocerebral activity resulting from stimulation of the left and right visual fields. The stimulus consisted of two squares, one in each visual field, flickering at different frequencies. Bispectra, bichoherence and biphase were calculated for 8 subjects monocularly observing a visual stimulus. Both phase vs. frequency and biphase vs. frequency plots were made to determine weighted time delays from stimulus application to signal appearance in the EEG electrodes. Bispectral analysis reveals non-liner interactions between visual fields occurring with weighted delay times of 410 + / - 58 msec while non-interactive components propagated with weighted time delays of 202 + / - 39 msec. Evaluating these results in light of the predictions of various models, we were able to conclude that this interaction does not occur in the retina. These results illustrate how bispectral analysis can be a powerful tool in analyzing the connectivity of neural networks in complex systems. It allows different neuronal systems to be labeled with stimuli at specific frequencies, whose connections can be traced using frequency analysis of the scalp EEG.},

abstract = {The cross-bispectrum is an approach to detect the presence of quadratic phase coupling (QPC) between different components in bivariate signals. Quantification of QPC is by means of the cross-bicoherence index (CBI). The major limitations of the CBI are that it favors only the strongly coupled signals and its accuracy becomes compromised with noise and low coupling strength. To overcome this limitation, a statistical approach which combines CBI with a surrogate data method to determine the statistical significance of the QPC derived from bivariate signals is introduced. We demonstrate the accuracy of the proposed approach using simulation examples which are designed to test its robustness against noise contamination as well as varying levels of phase coupling and data lengths. Comparisons were made to the traditional CBI and the method based on the use of cross-bispectrum followed by a surrogate data technique. Our results show that the cross-bicoherence with surrogate data technique outperforms the two other methods compared in both sensitivity and specificity, and provides an unbiased and statistical approach to determining the presence of QPC in bivariate signals. These results are in contrast to our recent study where the auto-bispectrum combined with surrogate data approach had the best performance. Application of this approach to renal hemodynamic data was applied to renal stop flow pressure data obtained in the nephrons of the normotensive (N = 18) and hypertensive (N = 15) rats. We found significant nonlinear interactions between nephrons only when they are derived from the same cortical renal artery. The accuracy was 100\% and verified by comparing the results to the known vascular connectivity between nephrons.},

The model provides a single framework for unifying different aspects of activity. Comparisons of the predicted spectra with published electrocorticographic, electroencephalographic, and evoked response potential data enable physiology and anatomy to be inferred, producing results which are complementary to those obtained from comparisons in the frequency domain; the inferred quantities are consistent with, and complementary to, direct physiological and anatomical measurements. We also use the model to quantify the interdependence of the wavenumber and frequency domains, and deduce that further experiments that cover large wavenumber and frequency ranges simultaneously would greatly increase our knowledge of brain function. We conclude that both the frequency and wavenumber domains should be studied in order to build the fullest picture of brain dynamics: the two domains are both complementary and interdependent.},

abstract = {The thalamus has traditionally been thought to passively relay sensory information to the cortex. By showing that responses in visual thalamus are modulated by perceptual and cognitive tasks, recent fMRI and physiology studies have helped revise this view. The modulatory input to the visual thalamus derives from functionally distinct cortical and subcortical feedback pathways. These pathways enable the lateral geniculate nucleus and pulvinar to regulate the information transmitted to cortical areas according to cognitive requirements. Emerging evidence suggests that such regulation involves changing the degree of synchrony between neurons as well as changing the magnitude of thalamic activity. These findings support a role for the thalamus that extends as far as contributing to the control of visual attention and awareness.},

Using real-time assessments of tetramethylammonium diffusion and two-photon imaging in live mice, we show that natural sleep or anesthesia are associated with a 60\% increase in the interstitial space, resulting in a striking increase in convective exchange of cerebrospinal fluid with interstitial fluid. In turn, convective fluxes of interstitial fluid increased the rate of $\beta$-amyloid clearance during sleep. Thus, the restorative function of sleep may be a consequence of the enhanced removal of potentially neurotoxic waste products that accumulate in the awake central nervous system.},

abstract = {The effects of different EEG brain states on spontaneous firing of cortical populations are not well understood. Such state shifts may occur frequently under natural conditions, and baseline firing patterns can impact neural coding (e.g., signal-to-noise ratios, sparseness of coding). Here, we examine the effects of spontaneous transitions from alert to nonalert awake EEG states in the rabbit visual cortex (5 s before and after the state-shifts). In layer 4, we examined putative spiny neurons and fast-spike GABAergic interneurons; in layer 5, we examined corticotectal neurons. We also examined the behavior of retinotopically aligned dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (LGNd) neurons, usually recorded simultaneously with the above cortical populations. Despite markedly reduced firing and sharply increased bursting in the LGNd neurons following the transition to the nonalert state, little change occurred in the spiny neurons of layer 4. However, fast-spike neurons of layer 4 showed a paradoxical increase in firing rates as thalamic drive decreased in the nonalert state, even though some of these cells received potent monosynaptic input from the same LGNd neurons whose rates were reduced. The firing rates of corticotectal neurons of layer 5, similarly to spiny cells of layer 4, were not state-dependent, but these cells did become more bursty in the nonalert state, as did the fast-spike cells. These results show that spontaneous firing rates of midlayer spiny populations are remarkably conserved following the shift from alert to nonalert states, despite marked reductions in excitatory thalamic drive and increased activity in local fast-spike inhibitory interneurons.},

In primary visual cortex (V1) in particular, adaptation controls the responsiveness of individual neurons and shifts their visual selectivity. What benefits does adaptation confer on a neuronal population? We measured adaptation in the responses of populations of cat V1 neurons to stimulus ensembles with markedly different statistics of stimulus orientation. We found that adaptation served two homeostatic goals. First, it maintained equality in the time-averaged responses across the population. Second, it maintained independence in selectivity across the population. Adaptation scaled and distorted population activity according to a simple multiplicative rule that depended on neuronal orientation preference and on stimulus orientation. We conclude that adaptation in V1 acts as a mechanism of homeostasis, enforcing a tendency toward equality and independence in neural activity across the population.},

@article{Barry20072765,
abstract = {Objective Recent work has attempted to clarify the energetics of physiological responding and behaviour by refining and separating the operational definitions of 'arousal' and 'activation', which have different effects on physiological responding and behaviour. At the EEG level, we relate the former to widespread activity, and the latter to task-specific topographically-focussed activity reflecting regional processing. This study aimed to investigate this further in terms of differences in EEG activity between eyes-closed and eyes-open resting conditions.Methods EEG activity was recorded from 28 university students during both eyes-closed and eyes-open resting conditions, Fourier transformed to provide estimates for absolute power in the delta, theta, alpha and beta bands, and analysed in 9 regions across the scalp. Skin conductance level was also measured as an indicator of arousal level. Results Across the eyes-closed conditions, skin conductance levels were negatively correlated with mean alpha levels. Skin conductance levels increased significantly from eyes-closed to eyes-open conditions. Reductions were found in across-scalp mean absolute delta, theta, alpha and beta from the eyes-closed to eyes-open condition. Topographic changes were also evident in all bands except for alpha, with reduced lateral frontal delta and posterior theta, and decreased posterior/increased frontal beta in the eyes-open condition. In particular, the topographic beta effects indicate that the across-scalp reduction arose from focal reductions rather than global changes. Conclusions The obtained results confirm the use of mean alpha level as a measure of resting-state arousal under eyes-closed and eyes-open conditions. The focal nature of EEG effects in the other bands suggests that these reflect cortical processing of visual input, producing differences in activation between eyes-closed and eyes-open resting conditions, rather than just the simple increase in arousal level shown in alpha. Significance This study demonstrates that the eyes-closed and eyes-open conditions provide EEG measures differing in topography as well as power levels. These differences should be recognised when evaluating EEG research, and considered when choosing eyes-open or eyes-closed baseline conditions for different paradigms.},
annote = {- useful graph of average powers
- alpha activity showed a significant reduction from ec to eo conditions
- so did delta, theta and beta. For theta and beta, the fractional reduction wasn't as large as for alpha or delta- but the biggest reduction was alpha
- In the data set here, the alpha power and delta power were approximately equal (in absolute terms) for EO, suggesting this is a possible measure for constraining in our problem
- In the delta band, opening of the eyes produced significantly greater reductions in frontal and lateral regions, suggesting focal reductions in these regions occurring with, and contributing to, the significant global reduction in delta activity. Theta activity was globally reduced by opening the eyes, but these reductions were significantly larger in posterior regions. Beta reductions from eyes-closed to eyes-open conditions were dominant in posterior and right hemisphere regions, and appeared to be uniquely accompanied by increased activity in frontal hemispheric regions. The balance of this decrease and increase in focal beta activity led to a significant across-scalp average reductions in power with opening of the eyes, but care needs to be exercised in interpreting this statistical result without acknowledgement of its focal basis.
- The alpha band appears different from the other bands in having a widespread reduction in activity from ec to eo conditions, with no topographic changes. Compared with the other bands, opening of the eyes produced a relatively fixed reduction of approximately 40\% of the ec activity at each site 
- These results need to be interpreted in relation to the framework provided by Barry et al 2005 which argued that changes in global EEG activity and SCL reflect shifts in arousal, while changes in EEG topography reflect separable task- or situation-related activation processes resulting form stimulus processing
- The current results, with higher SCL and global reduction of alpha in the eo condition, indicate an increase in arousal. This could reflect the uncoupling of vast thalamo-cortical interactions to aid the processing of visual information},

abstract = {Uncertainty is ubiquitous in our sensorimotor interactions, arising from factors such as sensory and motor noise and ambiguity about the environment. Setting it apart from previous theories, a quintessential property of the Bayesian framework for making inference about the state of world so as to select actions, is the requirement to represent the uncertainty associated with inferences in the form of probability distributions. In the context of sensorimotor control and learning, the Bayesian framework suggests that to respond optimally to environmental stimuli the central nervous system needs to construct estimates of the sensorimotor transformations, in the form of internal models, as well as represent the structure of the uncertainty in the inputs, outputs and in the transformations themselves. Here we review Bayesian inference and learning models that have been successful in demonstrating the sensitivity of the sensorimotor system to different forms of uncertainty as well as recent studies aimed at characterizing the representation of the uncertainty at different computational levels.},

abstract = {We propose a linear ballistic accumulator (LBA) model of decision making and reaction time. The LBA is simpler than other models of choice response time, with independent accumulators that race towards a common response threshold. Activity in the accumulators increases in a linear and deterministic manner. The simplicity of the model allows complete analytic solutions for choices between any number of alternatives. These solutions (and freely-available computer code) make the model easy to apply to both binary and multiple choice situations. Using data from five previously published experiments, we demonstrate that the LBA model successfully accommodates empirical phenomena from binary and multiple choice tasks that have proven difficult for other theoretical accounts. Our results are encouraging in a field beset by the tradeoff between complexity and completeness. ?? 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

@article{Srinivasan2007,
abstract = {We contrasted coherence estimates obtained with EEG, Laplacian, and MEG measures of synaptic activity using simulations with head models and simultaneous recordings of EEG and MEG. EEG coherence is often used to assess functional connectivity in human cortex. However, moderate to large EEG coherence can also arise simply by the volume conduction of current through the tissues of the head. We estimated this effect using simulated brain sources and a model of head tissues (cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), skull, and scalp) derived from MRI. We found that volume conduction can elevate EEG coherence at all frequencies for moderately separated (<10 cm) electrodes; a smaller levation is observed with widely separated (>20 cm) electrodes. This volume conduction effect was readily observed in experimental EEG at high frequencies (40-50 Hz). Cortical sources generating spontaneous EEG in this band are apparently uncorrelated. In contrast, lower frequency EEG coherence appears to result from a mixture of volume conduction effects and genuine source coherence. Surface Laplacian EEG methods minimize the effect of volume conduction on coherence estimates by emphasizing sources at smaller spatial scales than unprocessed potentials (EEG). MEG coherence estimates are inflated at all frequencies by the field spread across the large distance between sources and sensors. This effect is most apparent at sensors separated by less than 15 cm in tangential directions along a surface passing through the sensors. In comparison to long-range (>20 cm) volume conduction effects in EEG, widely spaced MEG sensors show smaller field-spread effects, which is a potentially significant advantage. However, MEG coherence estimates reflect fewer sources at a smaller scale than EEG coherence and may only partially overlap EEG coherence. EEG, Laplacian, and MEG coherence emphasize different spatial scales and orientations of sources.},

abstract = {The question of nonlinearity in the human electroencephalogram (EEG) is important, since linear methods of EEG analysis are more well-developed and computationally faster than nonlinear methods. Furthermore, the presence or absence of nonlinearity has important theoretical implications for understanding the nature of the brain's oscillatory activity. Using a linear summary measure as a control, we report a failure to reject the null hypothesis of a (largely) stationary linear-Gaussian process for normal, resting, eyes-closed EEG from a single participant. We found significant evidence of nonlinearity at two occipital sites (O1 and O2) where the 8-12.5 Hz alpha rhythm was prominent. However, this element of nonlinear structure appeared trivial, as (1) we found no evidence of time irreversibility at these loci, and (2) best-fitting linear models accounted on-average for over 94\% of the variance in the data with nonlinear modeling doing no better. Half of the remaining variance could be accounted for by nonstationarity. While our findings technically apply only to the one individual tested, his EEG was typical of those seen under the conditions that we employed.},

abstract = {The mode of action of afferents arising from the brainstem peribrachial region at the midbrain-pontine junction on neurons recorded from the reticular thalamic sector adjacent to the lateral geniculate nucleus (perigeniculate cells) was investigated at the intracellular level in the cat. Experiments were performed in cats under barbiturate or urethane anaesthesia and in non-anaesthetized deafferented animals. Most cats were pretreated with reserpine (1-2 mg/kg) and were also acutely deprived of their retinal and cortical visual inputs. It was found that peribrachial stimulation produced a short train of fast-rising depolarizations followed by a long-lasting period of hyperpolarization in all perigeniculate neurons. Although the latest part of the early depolarizations preceding the hyperpolarization resulted from a parallel activation of lateral geniculate relay neurons by peribrachial afferents, those occurring at shortest latencies appear to result from a direct excitation produced by peribrachial afferents. Furthermore, these early excitatory postsynaptic potentials persisted under deep barbiturate anaesthesia, a condition that prevents activation of thalamic relay neurons by peribrachial stimulation. The evoked hyperpolarization decreased with membrane hyperpolarization, was associated with a 40-50\% increase in membrane conductance and was insensitive to Cl injections. It was no longer observed within one hour after i.v. injection of scopolamine. However, the depolarizing responses were not depressed by this muscarinic antagonist. Iontophoretic applications of scopolamine also removed peribrachial-evoked inhibition of synaptic responses triggered by optic chiasma stimulation. The peribrachial input exerted a powerful control on the oscillatory behavior of perigeniculate neurons. Spindle oscillations which are generated within the reticular thalamic complex were readily blocked by peribrachial stimulation. It is then concluded that the transition from an oscillatory to a relay mode of operation in the thalamus is controlled at least in part by a muscarinic inhibition of reticular thalamic neurons. The synaptic mechanism responsible for the early depolarization remains to be elucidated.},

abstract = {Recent studies have highlighted the modulation and control of feedback gains as support for optimal feedback control. While many experiments contrast feedback gains across different environments, only a few have demonstrated the appropriate modulation of feedback gains from one movement to the next. Here we extend previous work by examining whether different visuomotor feedback gains can be learned for different directions of movement or perturbation directions in the same posture. To do this we measure visuomotor responses (involuntary motor responses to shifts in the visual feedback of the hand) during reaching movements. Previous work has demonstrated that these feedback responses can be modulated depending on the statistical distributions of the environment. Specifically, feedback gains were up-regulated for task-relevant environments and down-regulated for task-irrelevant environments. Using these two statistical distributions, the first experiment examined whether these feedback responses could be independently modulated for the same limb posture for two directions of movement (same limb posture but on either an inward or outward movement), while the second examined whether the feedback responses could modulate, within a single movement, to perturbations to the left or right of the reach. Both experiments demonstrated that visuomotor feedback responses could be learned independently such that the response was appropriate for the environment. This work demonstrates that feedback gains can be simultaneously tuned (up-regulated and down-regulated) depending on the state of the body and the environment. The results indicate the degree to which feedback responses can be fractionated in order to adapt to the world.},

The concept of reduced coherency is shown to be in semi-quantitative agreement with experimental EEG data. The impact of volume conduction on statistical confidence intervals for coherence estimates is discussed. Conventional reference, average reference, bipolar, Laplacian, and cortical image coherencies are shown to be partly independent measures of neocortical dynamic function at different spatial scales, due to each method's unique spatial filtering of intracranial source activity.},

abstract = {A set of nonlinear continuum field equations is presented which describes the dynamics of neural activity in cortex. These take into account the most pertinent anatomical and physiological features found in cortex with all parameter values obtainable from independent experiment. Derivation of a white noise fluctuation spectrum from a linearized set of equations shows the presence of strong resonances that correspond to electroencephalographically observed 0.3-4 Hz (mammalian delta), 4-8 Hz (mammalian theta), 8-13 Hz (mammalian alpha) and >13 Hz (mammalian beta) activity. Numerical solutions of a full set of one-dimensional nonlinear equations include properties analogous to cortical evoked potentials, travelling waves at experimentally observed velocities, threshold type spike activity and limit cycle, chaotic and noise driven oscillations at the frequency of the mammalian alpha rhythm. All these types of behaviour are generated with parameters that are within ranges reported experimentally. The strong dependence of the phenomena observed on inhibitory-inhibitory interactions is demonstrated. These results suggest that the classically described alpha may be instantiated in a number of qualitatively distinct dynamical regimes, all of which depend on the integrity of inhibitory-inhibitory population interactions.},

abstract = {To address the subjectivity in manual scoring of polysomnograms, a computer-assisted sleep staging method is presented in this paper. The method uses the principles of segmentation and self-organization (clustering) based on primitive sleep-related features to find the pseudonatural stages present in the record. Sample epochs of these natural stages are presented to the user, who can classify them according to the Rechtschaffen and Kales (RK) or any other standard. The method then learns from these samples to complete the classification. This step allows the active participation of the operator in order to customize the staging to his/her preferences. The method was developed and tested using 12 records of varying types (normal, abnormal, male, female, varying age groups). Results showed an overall concurrence of 80.6\% with manual scoring of 20-s epochs according to RK standard. The greatest amount of errors occurred in the identification of the highly transitional Stage 1, 54\% of which was misclassified into neighboring stages 2 or Wake.},

abstract = {We report that visual stimulation produces an easily detectable (5-20\%) transient increase in the intensity of water proton magnetic resonance signals in human primary visual cortex in gradient echo images at 4-T magnetic-field strength. The observed changes predominantly occur in areas containing gray matter and can be used to produce high-spatial-resolution functional brain maps in humans. Reducing the image-acquisition echo time from 40 msec to 8 msec reduces the amplitude of the fractional signal change, suggesting that it is produced by a change in apparent transverse relaxation time T*2. The amplitude, sign, and echo-time dependence of these intrinsic signal changes are consistent with the idea that neural activation increases regional cerebral blood flow and concomitantly increases venous-blood oxygenation.},

abstract = {Human sleep is a global state whose functions remain unclear. During much of sleep, cortical neurons undergo slow oscillations in membrane potential, which appear in electroencephalograms as slow wave activity (SWA) of <4 Hz. The amount of SWA is homeostatically regulated, increasing after wakefulness and returning to baseline during sleep. It has been suggested that SWA homeostasis may reflect synaptic changes underlying a cellular need for sleep. If this were so, inducing local synaptic changes should induce local SWA changes, and these should benefit neural function. Here we show that sleep homeostasis indeed has a local component, which can be triggered by a learning task involving specific brain regions. Furthermore, we show that the local increase in SWA after learning correlates with improved performance of the task after sleep. Thus, sleep homeostasis can be induced on a local level and can benefit performance.},

abstract = {We have compared sleep staging by an automated neural network (ANN) system, BioSleep (Oxford BioSignals) and a human scorer using the Rechtschaffen and Kales scoring system. Sleep study recordings from 114 patients with suspected obstructed sleep apnoea syndrome (OSA) were analysed by ANN and by a blinded human scorer. We also examined human scorer reliability by calculating the agreement between the index scorer and a second independent blinded scorer for 28 of the 114 studies. For each study, we built contingency tables on an epoch-by-epoch (30 s epochs) comparison basis. From these, we derived kappa (kappa) coefficients for different combinations of sleep stages. The overall agreement of automatic and manual scoring for the 114 studies for the classification \{wake / light-sleep / deep-sleep / REM\} was poor (median kappa = 0.305) and only a little better (kappa = 0.449) for the crude \{wake / sleep\} distinction. For the subgroup of 28 randomly selected studies, the overall agreement of automatic and manual scoring was again relatively low (kappa = 0.331 for \{wake light-sleep / deep-sleep REM\} and kappa = 0.505 for \{wake / sleep\}), whereas inter-scorer reliability was higher (kappa = -0.641 for \{wake / light-sleep / deep-sleep / REM\} and kappa = 0.737 for \{wake / sleep\}). We conclude that such an ANN-based analysis system is not sufficiently accurate for sleep study analyses using the R\&K classification system.},

abstract = {Spike-wave discharges (SWD) are electroencephalographic hallmarks of absence epilepsy. SWD are known to originate from thalamo-cortical neuronal network that normally produces sleep spindle oscillations. Although sleep spindles and SWD are considered as thalamo-cortical oscillations, functional relationship between them is not obvious. The present study describes temporal dynamics of SWD and sleep spindles as determined in 24h EEG recorded in WAG/Rij rat model of absence epilepsy. SWD, sleep spindles (10-15 Hz) and 5-9 Hz oscillations were automatically detected in EEG using wavelet-based algorithm. It was found that non-linear dynamics of SWD fitted well to the law of 'on-off intermittency'. Sleep spindles also demonstrated 'on-off intermittency', in contrast to 5-9 Hz oscillations, whose dynamics could not be classified as having any known type of non-linear behavior. Intermittency in sleep spindles and SWD implies that (1) temporal dynamics of these oscillations are deterministic in nature, and (2) it might be controlled by a system-level mechanism responsible for circadian modulation of neuronal network activity.},

Increasingly, these oscillations are of biological and clinical interest because of their role in development, learning and neurological disorders. We used an Internet interface to crowdsource spindle identification by human experts and non-experts, and we compared their performance with that of automated detection algorithms in data from middle- to older-aged subjects from the general population. We also refined methods for forming group consensus and evaluating the performance of event detectors in physiological data such as electroencephalographic recordings from polysomnography. Compared to the expert group consensus gold standard, the highest performance was by individual experts and the non-expert group consensus, followed by automated spindle detectors. This analysis showed that crowdsourcing the scoring of sleep data is an efficient method to collect large data sets, even for difficult tasks such as spindle identification. Further refinements to spindle detection algorithms are needed for middle- to older-aged subjects.},

abstract = {Summary 1. The organization of the n. reticularis thalami has been studied in 500 mouse, rat, and cat brains constituting at least 10,000 histological sections. All material was stained by modifications of the rapid Golgi method, and controlled with Golgi-Cox, Nissl, Kluver and Bielschowsky preparations. 2. The dominant orientation of dendritic mass of reticularis cells is perpendicular to the course of thalamo-cortical and cortico-thalamic radiations which traverse the field. 3. The dendrites are characterized by long filamentous spines, often 10 [mu] in length or more. They are thought to increase the available area of dendrite membrane, lying along and thrust into small fascicles of passage fibers. 4. The neuropil plexus of the field consists of collaterals from the thalamocortical and cortico-thalamic fibers of passage, and from the first portion of reticularis cell axons. This presynaptic neuropil spreads throughout the entire nucleus and forms the matrix within which reticularis cells are embedded. 5. The great majority of reticularis neurons send their large axons caudad into the thalamus where they synapse widely with neurons of specific and non-specific systems. Many axons break up into 2, 3, or more major caudal-running branches so 6. A very restricted number of the neurons we have examined (4\%) send small caliber branches rostrally, but it is believed that these terminate within the corpus striatum. 7. We conclude that the n. reticularis thalami cannot be conceived as a final common pathway in the thalamic non-specific projection upon the cortex. It appears, rather, to represent a centrifugal system which projects the integrate of most thalamo-cortical and cortico-thalamic interactions back upon the specific and non-specific thalamic nuclei. It would thus appear to function as a critical link in a system of re-entrant circuits of many lengths. Serving as the capstone upon a hierarchy of polysynaptic loops of varying complexity, it might well modulate all ongoing thalamic activity as well as exerting control over interactions between the thalamus and the cortex.},

@article{VanDongen2003,
abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To inform the debate over whether human sleep can be chronically reduced without consequences, we conducted a dose-response chronic sleep restriction experiment in which waking neurobehavioral and sleep physiological functions were monitored and compared to those for total sleep deprivation. DESIGN: The chronic sleep restriction experiment involved randomization to one of three sleep doses (4 h, 6 h, or 8 h time in bed per night), which were maintained for 14 consecutive days. The total sleep deprivation experiment involved 3 nights without sleep (0 h time in bed). Each study also involved 3 baseline (pre-deprivation) days and 3 recovery days. SETTING: Both experiments were conducted under standardized laboratory conditions with continuous behavioral, physiological and medical monitoring. PARTICIPANTS: A total of n = 48 healthy adults (ages 21-38) participated in the experiments. INTERVENTIONS: Noctumal sleep periods were restricted to 8 h, 6 h or 4 h per day for 14 days, or to 0 h for 3 days. All other sleep was prohibited. RESULTS: Chronic restriction of sleep periods to 4 h or 6 h per night over 14 consecutive days resulted in significant cumulative, dose-dependent deficits in cognitive performance on all tasks. Subjective sleepiness ratings showed an acute response to sleep restriction but only small further increases on subsequent days, and did not significantly differentiate the 6 h and 4 h conditions. Polysomnographic variables and delta power in the non-REM sleep EEG-a putative marker of sleep homeostasis--displayed an acute response to sleep restriction with negligible further changes across the 14 restricted nights. Comparison of chronic sleep restriction to total sleep deprivation showed that the latter resulted in disproportionately large waking neurobehavioral and sleep delta power responses relative to how much sleep was lost. A statistical model revealed that, regardless of the mode of sleep deprivation, lapses in behavioral alertness were near-linearly related to the cumulative duration of wakefulness in excess of 15.84 h (s.e. 0.73 h). CONCLUSIONS: Since chronic restriction of sleep to 6 h or less per night produced cognitive performance deficits equivalent to up to 2 nights of total sleep deprivation, it appears that even relatively moderate sleep restriction can seriously impair waking neurobehavioral functions in healthy adults. Sleepiness ratings suggest that subjects were largely unaware of these increasing cognitive deficits, which may explain why the impact of chronic sleep restriction on waking cognitive functions is often assumed to be benign. Physiological sleep responses to chronic restriction did not mirror waking neurobehavioral responses, but cumulative wakefulness in excess of a 15.84 h predicted performance lapses across all four experimental conditions. This suggests that sleep debt is perhaps best understood as resulting in additional wakefulness that has a neurobiological "cost" which accumulates over time.},

abstract = {Bicoherence quantifies the degree of quadratic phase coupling among different frequency components within a signal. Previous studies, using Fourier-based methods of bicoherence calculation (FBIC), have demonstrated that electroencephalographic bicoherence can be related to the end-tidal concentration of inhaled anesthetic drugs. However, FBIC methods require excessively long sections of the encephalogram. This problem might be overcome by the use of wavelet-based methods. In this study, we compare FBIC and a recently developed wavelet bicoherence (WBIC) method as a tool to quantify the effect of isoflurane on the electroencephalogram. We analyzed a set of previously published electroencephalographic data, obtained from 29 patients who underwent elective abdominal surgery under isoflurane general anesthesia combined with epidural anesthesia. Nine potential indices of the electroencephalographic anesthetic effect were obtained from the WBIC and FBIC techniques. The relationship between each index and end-tidal concentrations of isoflurane was evaluated using correlation coefficients (r), the inter-individual variations (CV) of index values, the coefficient of determination (R(2)) of the PKPD models and the prediction probability (P(K)). The WBIC-based indices tracked anesthetic effects better than the traditional FBIC-based ones. The DiagBic\_En index (derived from the Shannon entropy of the diagonal bicoherence values) performed best [r = 0.79 (0.66-0.92), CV = 0.08 (0.05-0.12), R(2) = 0.80 (0.75-0.85), P(K) = 0.79 (0.75-0.83)]. Short data segments of ∼10-30 s were sufficient to reliably calculate the indices of WBIC. The wavelet-based bicoherence has advantages over the traditional Fourier-based bicoherence in analyzing volatile anesthetic effects on the electroencephalogram.},

abstract = {STUDY OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of acute REM deprivation on daytime sleepiness/alertness, as measured by the MSLT. PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-six healthy, normal volunteers (14 males and 12 females) participated in this study. Participating subjects were in good physical and psychological health and were asymptomatic as to sleep/wake complaints. INTERVENTIONS: Subjects spent 5 nights and 5 days in the laboratory. The first night and day were utilized for screening purposes. The remaining stay in the laboratory consisted of a baseline night and day, 2 deprivation nights and days, and a recovery night and day. Each night, a nocturnal polysomnogram was employed to monitor subjects' sleep. Each day, subjects underwent an MSLT to evaluate their sleepiness/alertness. Subjects were randomized into REM-deprivation (RD) and yoked-control (YC) groups. On deprivation nights, RD subjects were awakened each time they entered stage REM sleep, and the YC subjects were awakened concomitantly with the RD subjects, assuming they were not in stage REM sleep. RESULTS: The REM-deprived subjects did not demonstrate any changes in MSLT scores across experimental days. In contrast, the YC subjects documented significantly lower MSLT scores on deprivation days due to decreased total sleep time. CONCLUSION: The REM-deprivation procedure antagonized the effects of sleep loss on daytime sleepiness, resulting in increased alertness for RD subjects compared to YC subjects. The mechanism by which REM deprivation exerts its alerting effects is unknown and will require future research.},

abstract = {Despite evidence that waking is associated with net synaptic potentiation and sleep with depression, direct proof for changes in synaptic currents is lacking in large brain areas such as the cerebral cortex. By recording miniature EPSCs (mEPSCs) from frontal cortex slices of mice and rats that had been awake or asleep, we found that the frequency and amplitude of mEPSCs increased after waking and decreased after sleep, independent of time of day. Recovery sleep after deprivation also decreased mEPSCs, suggesting that sleep favors synaptic homeostasis. Since stronger synapses require more energy, space, and supplies, a generalized renormalization of synapses may be an important function of sleep.},

abstract = {This paper presents a framework for creating neural field models from electrophysiological data. The Wilson and Cowan or Amari style neural field equations are used to form a parametric model, where the parameters are estimated from data. To illustrate the estimation framework, data is generated using the neural field equations incorporating modeled sensors enabling a comparison between the estimated and true parameters. To facilitate state and parameter estimation, we introduce a method to reduce the continuum neural field model using a basis function decomposition to form a finite-dimensional state-space model. Spatial frequency analysis methods are introduced that systematically specify the basis function configuration required to capture the dominant characteristics of the neural field. The estimation procedure consists of a two-stage iterative algorithm incorporating the unscented Rauch-Tung-Striebel smoother for state estimation and a least squares algorithm for parameter estimation. The results show that it is theoretically possible to reconstruct the neural field and estimate intracortical connectivity structure and synaptic dynamics with the proposed framework.},

abstract = {Plastic changes occurring during wakefulness aid in the acquisition and consolidation of memories. For some memories, further consolidation requires sleep, but whether plastic processes during wakefulness and sleep differ is unclear. We show that, in rat cortex and hippocampus, GluR1-containing AMPA receptor (AMPAR) levels are high during wakefulness and low during sleep, and changes in the phosphorylation states of AMPARs, CamKII and GSK3beta are consistent with synaptic potentiation during wakefulness and depression during sleep. Furthermore, slope and amplitude of cortical evoked responses increase after wakefulness, decrease after sleep and correlate with changes in slow-wave activity, a marker of sleep pressure. Changes in molecular and electrophysiological indicators of synaptic strength are largely independent of the time of day. Finally, cortical long-term potentiation can be easily induced after sleep, but not after wakefulness. Thus, wakefulness appears to be associated with net synaptic potentiation, whereas sleep may favor global synaptic depression, thereby preserving an overall balance of synaptic strength.},

abstract = {During human stage 2 non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, spontaneous K-complexes are more likely to occur prior to transitions to stage 3 or stage 4 sleep (referred to as slow wave sleep or SWS) compared to transitions to REM sleep, suggesting that the K-complex may be the 'forerunner' of SWS. The present study investigated the impact of SWS or REM sleep proximity on the probability of evoking a K-complex (pKC) during stage 2 and on components of the NREM sleep averaged evoked potential. Ten subjects spent three nights in the laboratory. On either the second or third night tones were presented continuously during sleep. Evoked K-complexes and sleep-evoked potentials were assessed for the 10 min of stage 2 prior to SWS (SWS-10) or REM (REM-10) sleep episodes as well as for all of SWS. pKC did not differ between SWS-10 (0.88) and SWS (0.91) but was significantly larger in SWS-10 than REM-10 (0.63). Amplitude effects were seen for the P2, N350, P900 NREM sleep-evoked potential components but not for the K-complex related N550. In each case where amplitude effects were found, SWS-10 was larger than REM-10. No latency differences were seen between conditions for the earlier components (P2, N350) however, both N550 and P900 were significantly shorter during SWS-10 compared to REM-10. These results are consistent with previous spontaneous K-complex studies and are supportive of a relationship between the K-complex and delta activity. They also indicate that stage 2 may consist of a continuum of microstates between SWS and REM sleep that are indicative of different brain stem, diecephalic and cortical patterns of activation.},

The largest event in healthy human EEGs is the K-complex (KC), which occurs in slow-wave sleep. Here, we show that KCs are generated in widespread cortical areas by outward dendritic currents in the middle and upper cortical layers, accompanied by decreased broadband EEG power and decreased neuronal firing, which demonstrate a steep decline in network activity. Thus, KCs are isolated "down-states," a fundamental cortico-thalamic processing mode already characterized in animals. This correspondence is compatible with proposed contributions of the KC to sleep preservation and memory consolidation.},

Results indicated that spindle density was the same in stages 2, 3, and 4, and was much lower in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. In stage 2, K potentials were less abundant than spindles and exhibited a much smaller individual variability. Whereas spindle density was very stable across two nights in the same subject, there was wide variation between subjects. In addition, there was a sex difference; female subjects presented more than twice as many spindles as males. The density of spindles during non-REM sleep was constant throughout the recording and did not show any cyclic variation.},

abstract = {During the past decade, several studies have demonstrated experimental evidence that temporal lobe seizures are preceded by changes in dynamical properties (both spatial and temporal) of electroencephalograph (EEG) signals. In this study, we evaluate a method, based on chaos theory and global optimization techniques, for detecting pre-seizure states by monitoring the spatio-temporal changes in the dynamics of the EEG signal. The method employs the estimation of the short-term maximum Lyapunov exponent (STL(max)), a measure of the order (chaoticity) of a dynamical system, to quantify the EEG dynamics per electrode site. A global optimization technique is also employed to identify critical electrode sites that are involved in the seizure development. An important practical result of this study was the development of an automated seizure warning system (ASWS). The algorithm was tested in continuous, long-term EEG recordings, 3-14 days in duration, obtained from 10 patients with refractory temporal lobe epilepsy. In this analysis, for each patient, the EEG recordings were divided into training and testing datasets. We used the first portion of the data that contained half of the seizures to train the algorithm, where the algorithm achieved a sensitivity of 76.12\% with an overall false prediction rate of 0.17h(-1). With the optimal parameter setting obtained from the training phase, the prediction performance of the algorithm during the testing phase achieved a sensitivity of 68.75\% with an overall false prediction rate of 0.15h(-1). The results of this study confirm our previous observations from a smaller number of patients: the development of automated seizure warning devices for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes is feasible and practically useful.},

We next review the precision of those simulation strategies, in particular in cases where plasticity depends on the exact timing of the spikes. We overview different simulators and simulation environments presently available (restricted to those freely available, open source and documented). For each simulation tool, its advantages and pitfalls are reviewed, with an aim to allow the reader to identify which simulator is appropriate for a given task. Finally, we provide a series of benchmark simulations of different types of networks of spiking neurons, including Hodgkin-Huxley type, integrate-and-fire models, interacting with current-based or conductance-based synapses, using clock-driven or event-driven integration strategies. The same set of models are implemented on the different simulators, and the codes are made available. The ultimate goal of this review is to provide a resource to facilitate identifying the appropriate integration strategy and simulation tool to use for a given modeling problem related to spiking neural networks.},

abstract = {The rhythmogenesis of 10-Hz sleep spindles is studied in a large-scale thalamic network model with two cell populations: the excitatory thalamocortical (TC) relay neurons and the inhibitory nucleus reticularis thalami (RE) neurons. Spindle-like bursting oscillations emerge naturally from reciprocal interactions between TC and RE neurons. We find that the network oscillations can be synchronized coherently, even though the RE-TC connections are random and sparse, and even though individual neurons fire rebound bursts intermittently in time. When the fast gamma-aminobutyrate type A synaptic inhibition is blocked, synchronous slow oscillations resembling absence seizures are observed. Near-maximal network synchrony is established with even modest convergence in the RE-to-TC projection (as few as 5-10 RE inputs per TC cell suffice). The hyperpolarization-activated cation current (Ih) is found to provide a cellular basis for the intermittency of rebound bursting that is commonly observed in TC neurons during spindles. Such synchronous oscillations with intermittency can be maintained only with a significant degree of convergence for the TC-to-RE projection.},

abstract = {The cortex is a complex system, characterized by its dynamics and architecture, which underlie many functions such as action, perception, learning, language, and cognition. Its structural architecture has been studied for more than a hundred years; however, its dynamics have been addressed much less thoroughly. In this paper, we review and integrate, in a unifying framework, a variety of computational approaches that have been used to characterize the dynamics of the cortex, as evidenced at different levels of measurement. Computational models at different space-time scales help us understand the fundamental mechanisms that underpin neural processes and relate these processes to neuroscience data. Modeling at the single neuron level is necessary because this is the level at which information is exchanged between the computing elements of the brain; the neurons. Mesoscopic models tell us how neural elements interact to yield emergent behavior at the level of microcolumns and cortical columns. Macroscopic models can inform us about whole brain dynamics and interactions between large-scale neural systems such as cortical regions, the thalamus, and brain stem. Each level of description relates uniquely to neuroscience data, from single-unit recordings, through local field potentials to functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), electroencephalogram (EEG), and magnetoencephalogram (MEG). Models of the cortex can establish which types of large-scale neuronal networks can perform computations and characterize their emergent properties. Mean-field and related formulations of dynamics also play an essential and complementary role as forward models that can be inverted given empirical data. This makes dynamic models critical in integrating theory and experiments. We argue that elaborating principled and informed models is a prerequisite for grounding empirical neuroscience in a cogent theoretical framework, commensurate with the achievements in the physical sciences.},

During the past decade, with the advent of multi-electrode recording and improved theoretical models, these questions have begun to yield answers. However, a complete understanding of neuronal variability, and, in particular, how it affects population codes, is missing. This is because variability in the brain is typically correlated, and although the exact effects of these correlations are not known, it is known that they can be large. Here, we review studies that address the interaction between neuronal noise and population codes, and discuss their implications for population coding in general.},

abstract = {The aim of this paper is to explain critical features of the human primary generalized epilepsies by investigating the dynamical bifurcations of a nonlinear model of the brain's mean field dynamics. The model treats the cortex as a medium for the propagation of waves of electrical activity, incorporating key physiological processes such as propagation delays, membrane physiology, and corticothalamic feedback. Previous analyses have demonstrated its descriptive validity in a wide range of healthy states and yielded specific predictions with regards to seizure phenomena. We show that mapping the structure of the nonlinear bifurcation set predicts a number of crucial dynamic processes, including the onset of periodic and chaotic dynamics as well as multistability. Quantitative study of electrophysiological data supports the validity of these predictions. Hence, we argue that the core electrophysiological and cognitive differences between tonic-clonic and absence seizures are predicted and interrelated by the global bifurcation diagram of the model's dynamics. The present study is the first to present a unifying explanation of these generalized seizures using the bifurcation analysis of a dynamical model of the brain.},

abstract = {Strong periodic stimuli such as bright flashing lights evoke nonlinear responses in the brain and interact nonlinearly with ongoing cortical activity, but the underlying mechanisms for these phenomena are poorly understood at present. The dominant features of these experimentally observed dynamics are reproduced by the dynamics of a quantitative neural field model subject to periodic drive. Model power spectra over a range of drive frequencies show agreement with multiple features of experimental measurements, exhibiting nonlinear effects including entrainment over a range of frequencies around the natural alpha frequency f($\alpha$), subharmonic entrainment near 2f($\alpha$), and harmonic generation. Further analysis of the driven dynamics as a function of the drive parameters reveals rich nonlinear dynamics that is predicted to be observable in future experiments at high drive amplitude, including period doubling, bistable phase-locking, hysteresis, wave mixing, and chaos indicated by positive Lyapunov exponents. Moreover, photosensitive seizures are predicted for physiologically realistic model parameters yielding bistability between healthy and seizure dynamics. These results demonstrate the applicability of neural field models to the new regime of periodically driven nonlinear dynamics, enabling interpretation of experimental data in terms of specific generating mechanisms and providing new tests of the theory.},

@article{Benardo1993,
abstract = {Intracellular recordings of layer V neurons from rat neocortical slices were obtained to examine the effects of reducing extracellular magnesium on inhibition. Magnesium-free solutions induced interictal and ictal-like events in cortical neurons. Changes in synaptic events underlying epileptogenesis were studied when extracellular calcium was raised (from 2 to 3-7 mM) since this delayed seizure activity. With increasing time of exposure of cells to magnesium-free solutions, there was a significant increase in the size and duration of both the depolarizing and slow synaptic hyperpolarizing responses, but the fast synaptic hyperpolarization significantly declined in amplitude. When cells were recorded with cesium acetate-filled microelectrodes slow hyperpolarizing responses were blocked, but depolarization of cells to 0 mV allowed an isolated fast hyperpolarizing response to be recorded following synaptic stimulation. The amplitude of this response was unchanged after exposure to magnesium-free solutions. Synaptic responses of cells initially bathed in an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonist (CPP) were unchanged by subsequent exposure to magnesium-free solutions. CPP exposure by itself caused a decrease in depolarization duration, increase in fast hyperpolarizing amplitude, and decrease in slow hyperpolarization amplitude and duration. When the fast hyperpolarization was viewed in isolation (cesium recording electrodes) at 0 mV, the amplitude of this event was unchanged by exposure to CPP. Given these results stimulus-response characteristics of neocortical neurons were reassessed under control conditions. With higher intensity stimuli larger depolarizing and slow hyperpolarizing responses were evoked, but the fast hyperpolarization showed a decremental response. These effects were reversed when CPP was added. When NMDA activity was enhanced by exposure to magnesium-free solutions or electrical stimulation, the amplitude of excitatory events and slow hyperpolarizations increased, but fast inhibitory responses showed limited capacity for incremental recruitment. This suggests fast inhibition is saturated (maximal) at submaximal levels of excitation, and can be overcome by increasing levels of excitation. Such a process is active under physiological conditions, altering the efficacy of inhibition.},

The latter is particularly interesting since the frequency of the limit cycle oscillation is found to be a monotonic function of stimulus intensity. Finally, it is proved that the existence of limit cycle dynamics in response to one class of stimuli implies the existence of multiple stable states and hysteresis in response to a different class of stimuli. The relation between these findings and a number of experiments is discussed.},

At the cellular level, the slow oscillation is built up by rhythmic membrane depolarizations and hyperpolarizations of cortical neurons. The EEG expression of this activity is marked by periodic K-complexes which reflect neuronal excitation. The slow oscillation triggers, groups and synchronizes other sleep rhythms, such as thalamically generated spindles as well as thalamically and cortically generated delta oscillations. We discuss the distinctness of the slow (< 1 Hz) and delta (1-4 Hz) oscillations. We also show that the slow cortical oscillation underlies the onset of spike-wave seizures during sleep by transforming the periodic K-complexes into recurrent paroxysmal spike-wave complexes.},

abstract = {Thalamocortical activity exhibits two distinct states: (a) synchronized rhythmic activity in the form of delta, spindle, and other slow waves during EEG-synchronized sleep and (b) tonic activity during waking and rapid-eye-movement sleep. Spindle waves are generated largely through a cyclical interaction between thalamocortical and thalamic reticular neurons involving both the intrinsic membrane properties of these cells and their anatomical interconnections. Specific alterations in the interactions between these cells can result in the generation of paroxysmal events resembling absence seizures in children. The release of several different neurotransmitters from the brain stem, hypothalamus, basal forebrain, and cerebral cortex results in a depolarization of thalamocortical and thalamic reticular neurons and an enhanced excitability in many cortical pyramidal cells, thereby suppressing the generation of sleep rhythms and promoting a state that is conducive to sensory processing and cognition.},

We can now image single molecules controlling cell differentiation, growth and death; single cells and their neurites processing electrical inputs and sending outputs; neuronal circuits performing neural computations in vitro; and the intact brain. At present, imaging based on voltage-sensitive dyes (VSDI) offers the highest spatial and temporal resolution for imaging neocortical functions in the living brain, and has paved the way for a new era in the functional imaging of cortical dynamics. It has facilitated the exploration of fundamental mechanisms that underlie neocortical development, function and plasticity at the fundamental level of the cortical column.},

abstract = {When we learn a new motor skill, such as playing an approaching tennis ball, both our sensors and the task possess variability. Our sensors provide imperfect information about the ball's velocity, so we can only estimate it. Combining information from multiple modalities can reduce the error in this estimate. On a longer time scale, not all velocities are a priori equally probable, and over the course of a match there will be a probability distribution of velocities. According to bayesian theory, an optimal estimate results from combining information about the distribution of velocities-the prior-with evidence from sensory feedback. As uncertainty increases, when playing in fog or at dusk, the system should increasingly rely on prior knowledge. To use a bayesian strategy, the brain would need to represent the prior distribution and the level of uncertainty in the sensory feedback. Here we control the statistical variations of a new sensorimotor task and manipulate the uncertainty of the sensory feedback. We show that subjects internally represent both the statistical distribution of the task and their sensory uncertainty, combining them in a manner consistent with a performance-optimizing bayesian process. The central nervous system therefore employs probabilistic models during sensorimotor learning.},

abstract = {STUDY OBJECTIVES: Methadone, a long-acting mu-opioid agonist, is an effective treatment for heroin addiction. Our previous data show that 6 of 10 methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) patients had central sleep apnea (CSA). This study aims to confirm these results and to investigate the pathogenesis of the CSA. METHODS: Twenty-five male and 25 female MMT patients and 20 age-, sex-, and body mass index (BMI)-matched normal subjects were tested with polysomnography, blood toxicology, and ventilatory responses to hypoxia and hypercapnia. Resting cardiorespiratory tests were performed in the MMT group RESULTS: MMT patients and normal subjects were 35 +/- 9 years old (mean +/- SD), and BMI values were 27 +/- 6 kg/m2 and 27 +/- 5 kg/m2, respectively. Thirty percent of MMT patients had a central apnea index (CAI) > 5, and 20\% had a CAI > 10. All normal subjects had a CAI < 1, and no difference was found in obstructive apnea-hypopnea index between the two groups. Methadone blood concentration was the only significant variable (t = 2.33, p = 0.025) associated with CAI and explains 12\% of the variance. Awake Pa(CO2), antidepressant use, reduced ventilatory response to hypercapnia, and widened awake alveolar-arterial oxygen pressure gradient together explain a further 17\% of the CAI variance. CONCLUSIONS: Thirty percent of stable MMT patients have CSA, a minority of which can be explained by blood methadone concentration. Other physiologic variables may also play a role in the pathogenesis of CSA in MMT patients, and further research is indicated in this area.},

abstract = {Topographical patterns of bipolar EEG coherence are frequency specific, indicating the presence of diverse neuroanatomical and neurophysiological factors in EEG production. Bipolar EEG coherence values were calculated at 50 frequency bins ranging from 3 to 28 Hz for 39 coherence pairs. Data were derived from 4.25 min of resting EEG obtained from 106 healthy adult male subjects and analyzed in 0.5 Hz bins by Fourier transform methods. Frequency bands were clearly separated at 8.5 and 13 Hz, with a less distinct separations at 6 and 20 Hz. Within pair (non-topographic) and across pair (topographic), measures gave similar patterns of separation. Significant pathways were primarily anterior-posterior interhemispheric or perpendicular to the anterior-posterior axis. There was little difference between left and right for comparable pairs. Theta band coherent activity involves distinct midline and temporal sources, with temporal sources showing anterior/posterior differentiation. In contrast, alpha activity has a distinct posterior focus, while beta activity shows no clear global structure. A spatially homogeneous model based on characteristics of thalamocortical connectivity accounts for much of the data, but departures from the model indicate the contribution of other neural factors to coherence.},

We estimated the Hurst exponent (H) and the range of fractal spectra (dD) in 10 healthy subjects. We found higher H values during NREM4 compared to NREM2 and REM in all electrodes. Measure dD showed an opposite trend. Differences of H and dD between NREM2 and REM reached significancy at circumscribed regions only. Our results contribute to a deeper understanding of the fractal nature of brain electrical activities and may have implications for automatic classification of sleep stages.},

abstract = {Biotinylated dextran amine (BDA) has been used frequently for both anterograde and retrograde pathway tracing in the central nervous system. Typically, BDA labels axons and cell somas in sufficient detail to identify their topographical location accurately. However, BDA labeling often has proved to be inadequate to resolve the fine structural details of axon arbors or the dendrites of neurons at a distance from the site of BDA injection. To overcome this limitation, we varied several experimental parameters associated with the BDA labeling of neurons in the adult rat brain in order to improve the sensitivity of the method. Specifically, we compared the effect on labeling sensitivity of: (a) using 3,000 or 10,000 MW BDA; (b) injecting different volumes of BDA; (c) co-injecting BDA with NMDA; and (d) employing various post-injection survival times. Following the extracellular injection of BDA into the visual cortex, labeled cells and axons were observed in both cortical and thalamic areas of all animals studied. However, the detailed morphology of axon arbors and distal dendrites was evident only under optimal conditions for BDA labeling that take into account the: molecular weight of the BDA used, concentration and volume of BDA injected, post-injection survival time, and toning of the resolved BDA with gold and silver. In these instances, anterogradely labeled axons and retrogradely labeled dendrites were resolved in fine detail, approximating that which can be achieved with intracellularly injected compounds such as biocytin or fluorescent dyes.},

abstract = {During recent years, methods from nonlinear dynamics were introduced into the analysis of EEG signals. Although from a theoretical point of view nonlinear measures quantify properties being independent from conventional spectral measures, it is a crucial question whether in practice nonlinear EEG measures yield additional information, which is not redundant to the information gained by spectral analysis. Therefore, we compared the ability of several spectral and nonlinear measures to discriminate different sleep stages. We evaluated spectral measures (relative delta power, spectral edge, spectral entropy and first spectral moment), and nonlinear measures (correlation dimension D2, largest Lyapunov exponent LI, and approximated Kolmogorof entropy K2), and additionally the stochastic time domain based measure entropy of amplitudes. For 12 healthy subjects these measures were calculated from sleep EEG segments of 2:44 min duration, each segment unambiguously corresponding to one of the sleep stages I, II, SWS and REM. Results were statistically evaluated by multivariate and univariate analyses of variance and by discriminant analyses. Generally, nonlinear measures (D2 and L1) performed better in discriminating sleep stages I and II, whereas spectral measures showed advantages in discriminating stage II and SWS. Combinations of spectral and nonlinear measures yielded a better overall discrimination of sleep stages than spectral measures alone. The best overall discrimination was reached even without inclusion of any of the spectral measures. It can be concluded that nonlinear measures yield additional information, which improves the ability to discriminate sleep stages and which may in general improve the ability to distinguish different psychophysiological states. This confirms the importance and practical reliability of the application of nonlinear methods to EEG analysis.},

abstract = {Objective This study examined the use of caffeine to manipulate arousal level without the confounds associated with task-related activation. From previous work in our laboratory, an increase in skin conductance level (SCL) and EEG alpha frequency, together with a global decrease in alpha power, were used as markers of arousal increase, and we sought to identify these effects with caffeine ingestion.Methods We examined the effect of a single oral dose of caffeine (250 mg) in a randomised double-blind placebo-controlled repeated-measures cross-over study. Eighteen healthy university students (mean age 21 years; 13/18 females) participated in two sessions 1 week apart. EEG and autonomic data (SCL, heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and respiration rate) from a 2 min eyes-closed epoch, commencing approximately 30 min after ingestion of caffeine or placebo, were examined.Results Caffeine was associated with increased SCL, a global reduction in EEG power in the alpha band, and a global increase in alpha frequency. There were no cardiovascular effects.Conclusions The positive results are consistent with recent electrodermal and EEG studies of arousal and suggest that caffeine may be utilised as a task-free means of manipulating arousal in future investigations. Further work is necessary to clarify the absence of cardiovascular effects, and to integrate those data with emerging conceptualisations of arousal and activation.Significance The present data support the use of caffeine as a simple tool to explore the role of arousal in both normal and atypical functioning, and this may be useful in determining the validity and importance of supposed hyper- or hypo-arousal in such syndromes as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (AD/HD).},

abstract = {Brainstem and thalamic structures are known to play a critical role in modulating sleep-wake cycles, but the extent to which the cerebral hemispheres are involved remains unclear. To study the role of the cerebral hemispheres in generating sleep EEG patterns, all-night polysomnographic recordings were collected in subjects with brain damage (n = 30) caused by hemispheric stroke and in hospitalized controls (n = 12). Recordings were made in the acute (< or =10 days post-stroke), subchronic (11-35 days post-stroke) and chronic (>60 days post-stroke) phases of stroke. Bipolar and referential EEG derivations were recorded. Standard sleep stage scoring was conducted using the referential derivation placed opposite the lesion. Sleep stage 2 power and coherence spectra were calculated based on recordings from bipolar derivations. In the mean spectra, the highest spindle frequency peak was identified and its size was calculated relative to the background spectrum. Analysis of visually scored EEG data indicated that, compared with controls, acute phase brain-damaged subjects had lower sleep efficiency and increased waking after sleep onset. The durations of rapid eye movement and non-rapid eye movement sleep stages did not differ significantly between brain-damaged subjects and hospitalized controls. Spectral analyses revealed that, compared with hospitalized controls, brain-damaged subjects had significantly reduced spindle peak sizes in the power and coherence spectra from derivations ipsilateral to the lesion. Within-subject comparisons across time demonstrated that the power and coherence of sleep spindle frequency activity increased significantly from the acute to the chronic phases of stroke, suggesting that plastic mechanisms allowed the possibility of recovery. Our findings provide novel evidence that the cerebral hemispheres are important in generating coherent sleep spindles in humans, and they are consonant with prior empirical and theoretical evidence that corticothalamic projections modulate the generation of synchronous spindle oscillations. Because spindle oscillations are thought to be involved in blocking sensory input to the cortex during sleep, the decrease in synchronous spindle frequency activity following hemispheric stroke may contribute to the observed reduction in sleep continuity.},

Extracellular neuronal activity is continuously recorded during field application through differential extracellular recording techniques, and the applied electric field strength is continuously updated using a computer-controlled proportional feedback algorithm. This approach appears capable of sustained amelioration of seizure events in this preparation when used with negative feedback. Seizures can be induced or enhanced by using fields of opposite polarity through positive feedback. In negative feedback mode, such findings may offer a novel technology for seizure control. In positive feedback mode, adaptively applied electric fields may offer a more physiological means of neural modulation for prosthetic purposes than previously possible.},

@article{Burk2014,
abstract = {After committing to an action, a decision-maker can change their mind to revise the action. Such changes of mind can even occur when the stream of information that led to the action is curtailed at movement onset. This is explained by the time delays in sensory processing and motor planning which lead to a component at the end of the sensory stream that can only be processed after initiation. Such post-initiation processing can explain the pattern of changes of mind by asserting an accumulation of additional evidence to a criterion level, termed change-of-mind bound. Here we test the hypothesis that physical effort associated with the movement required to change one's mind affects the level of the change-of-mind bound and the time for post-initiation deliberation. We varied the effort required to change from one choice target to another in a reaching movement by varying the geometry of the choice targets or by applying a force field between the targets. We show that there is a reduction in the frequency of change of mind when the separation of the choice targets would require a larger excursion of the hand from the initial to the opposite choice. The reduction is best explained by an increase in the evidence required for changes of mind and a reduced time period of integration after the initial decision. Thus the criteria to revise an initial choice is sensitive to energetic costs.},

abstract = {To investigate rapid eye movement (REM) sleep regulation, eight healthy young men were deprived of REM sleep for three consecutive nights. In a three-night control sleep deprivation (CD) session 2 wk later, the subjects were repeatedly awakened from non-REM sleep in an attempt to match the awakenings during the REM sleep deprivation (RD) nights. During the RD nights the number of sleep interruptions required to prevent REM sleep increased within and across consecutive nights. REM sleep was reduced to 9.2\% of baseline (CD nights: 80.7\%) and rose to 140.1\% in the first recovery night. RD gave rise to changes in the EEG power spectra of REM sleep. Power in the 8.25- to 11-Hz range was reduced in the first recovery night, an effect that gradually subsided but was still present in the third recovery night. The rising REM sleep propensity, as reflected by the increase of interventions within and across RD nights, and the moderate REM sleep rebound during recovery can be accounted for by a compensatory response that serves REM sleep homeostasis. The changes in the electroencephalogram power spectra, which were observed during enhanced REM sleep propensity, may be a sign of an altered quality of REM sleep.},

This study explored whether similar effects occur in children.Methods EEG activity was recorded from 30 children aged 8-12 years during counterbalanced eyes-closed and eyes-open resting conditions; SCL was measured as an index of arousal.Results SCLs were negatively correlated with mean alpha levels in the eyes-closed condition, and increased significantly from eyes-closed to eyes-open. Reductions were found in across-scalp mean absolute delta, theta, alpha, and beta from eyes-closed to eyes-open. Topographic changes were evident in all bands except alpha.Conclusions Results confirm the use of mean alpha level as a measure of resting-state arousal under eyes-closed and eyes-open conditions. Focal changes in the other bands suggest that these reflect differences in activation, rather than the simple increase in arousal shown in alpha.Significance This child study confirms the generality of eyes-closed vs. eyes-open non-alpha EEG measures differing in mean power levels and topography, the latter indicating brain activity related to visual processing. Such differences should be considered when evaluating EEG research, and in choosing baseline conditions for different paradigms.},

abstract = {Here we show that a mathematical model of the human sleep cycle can be used to obtain a detailed description of electroencephalogram (EEG) sleep stages, and we discuss how this analysis may aid in the prediction and prevention of seizures during sleep. The association between EEG data and the cortical model is found via locally linear embedding (LLE), a method of dimensionality reduction. We first show that LLE can distinguish between traditional sleep stages when applied to EEG data. It reliably separates REM and non-REM sleep and maps the EEG data to a low-dimensional output space where the sleep state changes smoothly over time. We also incorporate the concept of strongly connected components and use this as a method of automatic outlier rejection for EEG data. Then, by using LLE on a hybrid data set containing both sleep EEG and signals generated from the mesoscale cortical model, we quantify the relationship between the data and the mathematical model. This enables us to take any sample of sleep EEG data and associate it with a position among the continuous range of sleep states provided by the model; we can thus infer a trajectory of states as the subject sleeps. Lastly, we show that this method gives consistent results for various subjects over a full night of sleep and can be done in real time.},

abstract = {For many decades correlation and power spectrum have been primary tools for digital signal processing applications in the biomedical area. The information contained in the power spectrum is essentially that of the autocorrelation sequence; which is sufficient for complete statistical descriptions of Gaussian signals of known means. However, there are practical situations where one needs to look beyond autocorrelation of a signal to extract information regarding deviation from Gaussianity and the presence of phase relations. Higher order spectra, also known as polyspectra, are spectral representations of higher order statistics, i.e. moments and cumulants of third order and beyond. HOS (higher order statistics or higher order spectra) can detect deviations from linearity, stationarity or Gaussianity in the signal. Most of the biomedical signals are non-linear, non-stationary and non-Gaussian in nature and therefore it can be more advantageous to analyze them with HOS compared to the use of second-order correlations and power spectra. In this paper we have discussed the application of HOS for different bio-signals. HOS methods of analysis are explained using a typical heart rate variability (HRV) signal and applications to other signals are reviewed.},

abstract = {Human electroencephalogram (EEG) has been divided in bands established by visual inspection that frequently do not correspond with EEG generators nor with functional meaning of EEG rhythms. Power spectra from wakefulness, stage 2, stage 4 and paradoxical sleep of 8 young adults were submitted to Principal Component Analyses to investigate which frequencies covaried together. Two identical eigenvectors were identified for stage 2 and stage 4: 1 to 8 Hz and 5 to 15 Hz (87.95 and 84.62 \% of the total variance respectively). Two eigenvectors were extracted for PS: 1 to 9 Hz and 10 to 15 Hz (81.62\% of the total variance). Three eigenvectors were obtained for W: with frequencies between 1 to 7 Hz, 7 to 11 Hz, and 12 to 15 Hz (78.32\% of the total variance). Power for all frequencies showed significant differences among vigilance states. These results indicate that slow wave activity can oscillate at higher frequencies, up to 8 Hz, and that spindle oscillations have a wider range down to 5 Hz. No theta band was independently identified, suggesting either that delta and theta oscillations are two rhythms under the same global influence, or that the traditional division of theta band in the human cortical EEG is artificial. Alpha as a band was identified only during wakefulness. Principal component analysis upon spectral densities extracted broad bands different for each vigilance state and from traditional bands, consistent with functional significance of EEG and with frequencies of generators of rhythmic activity obtained in cellular studies in animals.},

abstract = {Epileptic activity in the form of spike-wave discharges (SWD) appears in the electroencephalogram (EEG) during absence seizures. A relationship between SWD and normal sleep spindles is often assumed. This study compares time-frequency parameters of SWD and sleep spindles as recorded in the EEG in the WAG/Rij rat model of absence epilepsy. Fast Fourier transformation and continuous wavelet transformation were used for EEG analysis. Wavelet analysis was performed in non-segmented full-length EEG. A specific wavelet-based algorithm was developed for the automatic identification of sleep spindles and SWD. None of standard wavelet templates provided precise identification of all sleep spindles and SWD in the EEG and different wavelet templates were imperative in order to accomplish this task. SWD were identified with high probability using standard Morlet wavelet, but sleep spindles were identified using two types of customized adoptive 'spindle wavelets'. It was found that (1) almost 100\% of SWD (but only 50-60\% of spindles) were identified using the Morlet-based wavelet transform. (2) 82-91\% of sleep spindles were selected using adoptive 'spindle wavelet 1' (template's peak frequency approximately 12.2 Hz), the remaining sleep spindles with 'spindle wavelet 2' (peak frequency approximately 20-25 Hz). (3) Sleep spindles and SWD were detected by the elevation of wavelet energy in different frequencies: SWD, in 30-50 Hz band, sleep spindles, in 7-14 Hz. It is concluded that the EEG patterns of sleep spindles and SWD belong to different families of phasic EEG events with different time frequency characteristics.},

abstract = {At present, the prime methodology for studying neuronal circuit-connectivity, physiology and pathology under in vitro or in vivo conditions is by using substrate-integrated microelectrode arrays. Although this methodology permits simultaneous, cell-non-invasive, long-term recordings of extracellular field potentials generated by action potentials, it is 'blind' to subthreshold synaptic potentials generated by single cells. On the other hand, intracellular recordings of the full electrophysiological repertoire (subthreshold synaptic potentials, membrane oscillations and action potentials) are, at present, obtained only by sharp or patch microelectrodes. These, however, are limited to single cells at a time and for short durations. Recently a number of laboratories began to merge the advantages of extracellular microelectrode arrays and intracellular microelectrodes. This Review describes the novel approaches, identifying their strengths and limitations from the point of view of the end users--with the intention to help steer the bioengineering efforts towards the needs of brain-circuit research.},

@article{Phillips2013,
abstract = {Human sleep episodes are characterized by an approximately 90-min ultradian oscillation between rapid eye movement (REM) and non-REM (NREM) sleep stages. The source of this oscillation is not known. Pacemaker mechanisms for this rhythm have been proposed, such as a reciprocal interaction network, but these fail to account for documented homeostatic regulation of both sleep stages. Here, two candidate mechanisms are investigated using a simple model that has stable states corresponding to Wake, REM sleep, and NREM sleep. Unlike other models of the ultradian rhythm, this model of sleep dynamics does not include an ultradian pacemaker, nor does it invoke a hypothetical homeostatic process that exists purely to drive ultradian rhythms. Instead, only two inputs are included: the homeostatic drive for Sleep and the circadian drive for Wake. These two inputs have been the basis for the most influential Sleep/Wake models, but have not previously been identified as possible ultradian rhythm generators. Using the model, realistic ultradian rhythms are generated by arousal state feedback to either the homeostatic or circadian drive. For the proposed 'homeostatic mechanism', homeostatic pressure increases in Wake and REM sleep, and decreases in NREM sleep. For the proposed 'circadian mechanism', the circadian drive is up-regulated in Wake and REM sleep, and is down-regulated in NREM sleep. The two mechanisms are complementary in the features they capture. The homeostatic mechanism reproduces experimentally observed rebounds in NREM sleep duration and intensity following total sleep deprivation, and rebounds in both NREM sleep intensity and REM sleep duration following selective REM sleep deprivation. The circadian mechanism does not reproduce sleep state rebounds, but more accurately reproduces the temporal patterns observed in a normal night of sleep. These findings have important implications in terms of sleep physiology and they provide a parsimonious explanation for the observed ultradian rhythm of REM/NREM sleep.},

@article{VanGompel2010,
abstract = {OBJECT: Intracranial monitoring for temporal lobe seizure localization to differentiate neocortical from mesial temporal onset seizures requires both neocortical subdural grids and hippocampal depth electrode implantation. There are 2 basic techniques for hippocampal depth electrode implantation. This first technique uses a stereotactically guided 8-contact depth electrode directed along the long axis of the hippocampus to the amygdala via an occipital bur hole. The second technique involves direct placement of 2 or 3 4-contact depth electrodes perpendicular to the temporal lobe through the middle temporal gyrus and overlying subdural grid. The purpose of this study was to determine whether one technique was superior to the other by examining monitoring success and complications. METHODS: Between 1997 and 2005, 41 patients underwent invasive seizure monitoring with both temporal subdural grids and depth electrodes placed in 2 ways. Patients in Group A underwent the first technique, and patients in Group B underwent the second technique. RESULTS: Group A consisted of 26 patients and Group B 15 patients. There were no statistically significant differences between Groups A and B regarding demographics, monitoring duration, seizure localization, or outcome (Engel classification). There was a statistically significant difference at the point in time at which these techniques were used: Group A represented more patients earlier in the series than Group B (p < 0.05). The complication rate attributable to the grids and depth electrodes was 0\% in each group. It was more likely that the depth electrodes were placed through the grid if there was a prior resection and the patient was undergoing a new evaluation (p < 0.05). Furthermore, Group A procedures took significantly longer than Group B procedures. CONCLUSIONS: In this patient series, there was no difference in efficacy of monitoring, complications, or outcome between hippocampal depth electrodes placed laterally through temporal grids or using an occipital bur hole stereotactic approach. Placement of the depth electrodes perpendicularly through the grids and middle temporal gyrus is technically more practical because multiple head positions and redraping are unnecessary, resulting in shorter operative times with comparable results.},

The components of processing identified by the model were compared across levels of IQ (ranging from 83 to 146) and age (college students, 60-74, and 75-90 year olds). Declines in performance with age were not significantly different for low compared to high IQ subjects. IQ but not age had large effects on the quality of the evidence that was obtained from a stimulus or memory, that is, the evidence upon which decisions were based. Applying the model to individual subjects, the components of processing identified by the model for individuals correlated across tasks. In addition, the model's predictions and the data were examined for the "worst performance rule", the finding that age and IQ have larger effects on slower responses than faster responses.},

A method capable of predicting the occurrence of seizures from the electroencephalogram (EEG) of epilepsy patients would open new therapeutic possibilities. Since the 1970s investigations on the predictability of seizures have advanced from preliminary descriptions of seizure precursors to controlled studies applying prediction algorithms to continuous multi-day EEG recordings. While most of the studies published in the 1990s and around the turn of the millennium yielded rather promising results, more recent evaluations could not reproduce these optimistic findings, thus raising a debate about the validity and reliability of previous investigations. In this review, we will critically discuss the literature on seizure prediction and address some of the problems and pitfalls involved in the designing and testing of seizure-prediction algorithms. We will give an account of the current state of this research field, point towards possible future developments and propose methodological guidelines for future studies on seizure prediction.},

abstract = {STUDY OBJECTIVES: To evaluate epoch by epoch agreement in sleep stage assignment between scorers from different laboratories. DESIGN: N/A. METHODS: 62 NPSGs were selected for analysis from 3 sleep centers (38 diagnostic studies for sleep disordered breathing [SDB], 10 studies during CPAP titration, and 14 studies in subjects with no sleep related complaints or sleep pathology). The sleep recording montage consisted of at least 2 EEG leads, left and right EOG and a submental EMG. Scoring was performed manually by 5 experienced sleep technologists. No scorer had knowledge of any other scorers' results. Agreement was tabulated both for sleep stage distribution and on an epoch by epoch basis for the entire data set and the normal and SDB subsets. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: The mean epoch by epoch agreement between scorers for all records was 73\% (range 67-82\%). Agreements were higher in the normal subset (mean 76\%, range 65-85\%) than in the SDB subset (mean 71\%, range 65-78\%). There was significant variability in agreement between records and between pairs of scorers. Overall, 75\% of epochs had at least 4 of the 5 scorers in agreement on the sleep stage and 96\% of epochs had agreement of at least 3 of the 5 scorers. CONCLUSIONS: The level of agreement in sleep stage assignment varies between scorers, by diagnosis, and by record. The level of agreement between laboratories is lower than what can be maintained between scorers within the same laboratory. This warrants caution when comparing data scored in separate laboratories. The lower agreement in SDB patients supports the generally held view that sleep fragmentation makes application of the R\&K rules less reliable.},

@article{Amit1997,
abstract = {We investigate self-sustaining stable states (attractors) in networks of integrate-and-fire neurons. First, we study the stability of spontaneous activity in an unstructured network. It is shown that the stochastic background activity, of 1-5 spikes/s, is unstable if all neurons are excitatory. On the other hand, spontaneous activity becomes self-stabilizing in presence of local inhibition, given reasonable values of the parameters of the network. Second, in a network sustaining physiological spontaneous rates, we study the effect of learning in a local module, expressed in synaptic modifications in specific populations of synapses. We find that if the average synaptic potentiation (LTP) is too low, no stimulus specific activity manifests itself in the delay period. Instead, following the presentation and removal of any stimulus there is, in the local module, a delay activity in which all neurons selective (responding visually) to any of the stimuli presented for learning have rates which gradually increase with the amplitude of synaptic potentiation. When the average LTP increases beyond a critical value, specific local attractors (stable states) appear abruptly against the background of the global uniform spontaneous attractor. In this case the local module has two available types of collective delay activity: if the stimulus is unfamiliar, the activity is spontaneous; if it is similar to a learned stimulus, delay activity is selective. These new attractors reflect the synaptic structure developed during learning. In each of them a small population of neurons have elevated rates, which depend on the strength of LTP. The remaining neurons of the module have their activity at spontaneous rates. The predictions made in this paper could be checked by single unit recordings in delayed response experiments.},

@article{Yang2009,
abstract = {We have asked how sensory adaptation is represented in the response of a population of visual motion neurons and whether the neural adaptation could drive behavioral adaptation. Our approach was to evaluate the effects of about 10 s of motion adaptation on both smooth-pursuit eye movements and the responses of neuron populations in extrastriate middle temporal visual area (MT) in awake monkeys. Stimuli for neural recordings consisted of patches of 100\% correlated dot textures. There was a wide range of effects across neurons, but on average adaptation reduced the amplitude and width of the direction tuning curves of MT neurons, without large changes in the preferred direction. The effects were greatest when the direction of the adapting stimulus corresponded to the preferred direction of the MT neuron under study. Adaptation also reduced the amplitude of speed-tuning curves, again with the greatest effect when the adapting speed was equal to the preferred speed. The adapted tuning curves were shifted toward lower preferred speeds as the adapting speed increased. We constructed populations of model MT neurons based on our experimental sample and showed that the effects of adaptation on the direction and speed of pursuit eye movements were predicted when a variant of vector averaging decoded the responses of a subset of the neural population. We conclude that the effects of motion adaptation on the responses of MT neurons can support behavioral adaptation in pursuit eye movements.},

@article{Sitnikova2010,
abstract = {According to the most generally accepted cortico-reticular theory of absence epilepsy, sleep spindles and spike-wave discharges (SWD, characteristic hallmarks of absence epilepsy) are closely related. The present review critically evaluates this theory based on the original data obtained in WAG/Rij rat model of absence epilepsy. It is demonstrated that (1) sleep spindles and spike-wave discharges are distinguished in time-frequency domain. (2) EEG waveforms of sleep spindles and SWD are underlain by different synaptic processes, as determined with the aid of computational neuronal model of cortical field potentials. (3) Sleep spindles do not precede SWD. EEG analysis of SWD-precursor activity provides us with a clue to possible prediction of absence epilepsy episodes. Furthermore, by studying Granger causality and EEG coherence at the onset of SWD we gain more insight into the dynamics of the thalamo-cortical neuronal network associations that underlie occurrence of absence seizures. In general, spindle activity and SWD display different time-frequency characteristics as measured in cortex and thalamus, they are accompanied by different neuronal processes and require different involvement of neurotransmitters. Sleep spindles and SWD are considered as autonomous EEG phenomena, and straightforward relationship between them is doubtful.},

KC density and inter-KC intervals respectively decreased and increased across the sleep cycles, revealing linear trends. Comparisons among transitions from stage 2 to SWS or to REM sleep showed a prevalence of KCs before the shift to SWS as compared to REM. Changes in KC density before the shift to SWS were fitted by a linear regression, at variance with the transition to REM sleep. Intra-night variations of KCs, paralleling the well-known decrease of slow waves across sleep cycles, and intracycle variations before shifting to SWS, both converge to indicate that KCs can be considered as the forerunner of delta waves.},

abstract = {Background. Analysis of the bispectrum of EEG waveforms is a component of the proprietary BIS index--a commonly used commercial monitor of depth of anaesthesia. Does the use of the bispectrum give more information about depth of anaesthesia than the power spectrum? Methods. We collected and analysed EEG waveforms during induction of general anaesthesia in 39 patients, comparing the changes in bispectral parameter (SynchFastSlow), with an analogous power spectrum-based parameter (PowerFastSlow). Both compare the logarithmic ratio of high frequency components (40-47 Hz) with the total (1-47 Hz). Because the changes in bispectrum are affected by signal amplitude, we also calculated a third parameter (SFSbicoh) from the bicoherence, which is an amplitude-independent statistic. Results. The SynchFastSlow and PowerFastSlow were correlated (r=0.84) and neither was superior in predicting the awake or anaesthetized state (area under receiver operating characteristic curves = 0.85 vs 0.93). There was no change in the SFSbicoh over the induction period, and it did not correlate with SynchFastSlow (r=0.07). Conclusions. We could not show that bispectral analysis gave more information than power spectral-based analysis. Most of the changes in the bispectral values result from decreases in the relative high frequency content of the EEG caused by anaesthesia. Br J Anaesth 2004; 92: 8-13},
annote = {This paper looked at the use of the bispectrum and bicoherence in order to see if it was useful for determining the depth of anaesthesia. They compared it to a simpler measurement involving looking at the power spectrum.The result was that the bicoherence measure did not change at all (ie. the amount of phase coupling was more or less constant) and the bispectrum provided virtually identical trends as the power spectrum.However, this paper is misleading in that it only discusses normal EEG conditions, in the sense that a seizure is an abnormal electrical discharge and involves a domination of certain frequencies which may mean that phase coupling only occurs with seizures.Thus the take-home message from this paper is that the bicoherence measure is consistently low for normal brain activity.},

abstract = {Evoked potentials -- the brain's transient electrical responses to discrete stimuli -- are modeled as impulse responses using a continuum model of brain electrical activity. Previous models of ongoing brain activity are refined by adding an improved model of thalamic connectivity and modulation, and by allowing for two populations of excitatory cortical neurons distinguished by their axonal ranges. Evoked potentials are shown to be modelable as an impulse response that is a sum of component responses. The component occurring about 100 ms poststimulus is attributed to sensory activation, and this, together with positive and negative feedback pathways between the cortex and thalamus, results in subsequent peaks and troughs that semiquantitatively reproduce those of observed evoked potentials. Modulation of the strengths of positive and negative feedback, in ways consistent with psychological theories of attentional focus, results in distinct responses resembling those seen in experiments involving attentional changes. The modeled impulse responses reproduce key features of typical experimental evoked response potentials: timing, relative amplitude, and number of peaks. The same model, with further modulation of feedback, also reproduces experimental spectra. Together, these results mean that a broad range of ongoing and transient electrocortical activity can be understood within a common framework, which is parameterized by values that are directly related to physiological and anatomical quantities.},

abstract = {Low-threshold (T-type) Ca(2+) channels encoded by the Ca(V)3 genes endow neurons with oscillatory properties that underlie slow waves characteristic of the non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep EEG. Three Ca(V)3 channel subtypes are expressed in the thalamocortical (TC) system, but their respective roles for the sleep EEG are unclear. Ca(V)3.3 protein is expressed abundantly in the nucleus reticularis thalami (nRt), an essential oscillatory burst generator. We report the characterization of a transgenic Ca(V)3.3(-/-) mouse line and demonstrate that Ca(V)3.3 channels are indispensable for nRt function and for sleep spindles, a hallmark of natural sleep. The absence of Ca(V)3.3 channels prevented oscillatory bursting in the low-frequency (4-10 Hz) range in nRt cells but spared tonic discharge. In contrast, adjacent TC neurons expressing Ca(V)3.1 channels retained low-threshold bursts. Nevertheless, the generation of synchronized thalamic network oscillations underlying sleep-spindle waves was weakened markedly because of the reduced inhibition of TC neurons via nRt cells. T currents in Ca(V)3.3(-/-) mice were <30\% compared with those in WT mice, and the remaining current, carried by Ca(V)3.2 channels, generated dendritic [Ca(2+)](i) signals insufficient to provoke oscillatory bursting that arises from interplay with Ca(2+)-dependent small conductance-type 2 K(+) channels. Finally, naturally sleeping Ca(V)3.3(-/-) mice showed a selective reduction in the power density of the $\sigma$ frequency band (10-12 Hz) at transitions from NREM to REM sleep, with other EEG waves remaining unaltered. Together, these data identify a central role for Ca(V)3.3 channels in the rhythmogenic properties of the sleep-spindle generator and provide a molecular target to elucidate the roles of sleep spindles for brain function and development.},

abstract = {We demonstrate by using simulations that spatial embedding of single-variable time series data does not reliably reconstruct state-space dynamics. Instead, correlation dimension estimated from spatially embedded data is largely a measure of linear cross-correlation in the data set. For actual electroencephalographic (EEG) data, we demonstrate a high negative correlation between spatial correlation dimension and the average amount of lag-zero cross-correlation between "nearest-neighbor" embedding channels (the greater the cross-correlation, the lower the dimension). We also show that the essential results obtained from spatially embedding EEG data are also obtained when one spatially embeds across a set of highly cross-correlated stochastic (second-order autoregressive) processes. Although, with appropriate surrogate data, correlation dimension estimated from spatially embedded data detects nonlinearity, its use is not recommended because correlation dimension estimated from temporally embedded data both reconstructs state-space dynamics and, with appropriate surrogate data, detects nonlinearity as well.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT There is some complementarity of models for the origin of the electroencephalogram (EEG) and neural network models for information storage in brainlike systems. From the EEG models of Freeman, of Nunez, and of the authors' group we argue that the wavelike processes revealed in the EEG exhibit linear and near-equilibrium dynamics at macroscopic scale, despite extremely nonlinear dynamics at microscopic scale. Simulations of cortical neuronal interactions at global and microscopic scales are then presented. The simulations depend on anatomical and physiological estimates of synaptic densities, coupling symmetries, synaptic gain, dendritic time constants, and axonal delays. It is shown that the frequency content, wave velocities, frequency/wavenumber spectra and response to cortical activation of the electrocorticogram (ECoG) can be reproduced by a simulation treating small cortical areas as single-function units. The corresponding cellular neural network simulation has properties that include those of attractor neural networks proposed by Amit and by Parisi. Within the simulations at both scales, sharp transitions occur between low and high cell firing rates. These transitions may form a basis for neural interactions across scale. To maintain overall cortical dynamics in the normal low firing-rate range, interactions between the cortex and the subcortical systems are required to prevent runaway global excitation. Thus, the interaction of cortex and subcortex via corticostriatal and related pathways may partly regulate global dynamics by a principle analogous to adiabatic control of artificial neural networks.},

abstract = {The human brain is often considered to be the most cognitively capable among mammalian brains and to be much larger than expected for a mammal of our body size. Although the number of neurons is generally assumed to be a determinant of computational power, and despite the widespread quotes that the human brain contains 100 billion neurons and ten times more glial cells, the absolute number of neurons and glial cells in the human brain remains unknown. Here we determine these numbers by using the isotropic fractionator and compare them with the expected values for a human-sized primate. We find that the adult male human brain contains on average 86.1 +/- 8.1 billion NeuN-positive cells ("neurons") and 84.6 +/- 9.8 billion NeuN-negative ("nonneuronal") cells. With only 19\% of all neurons located in the cerebral cortex, greater cortical size (representing 82\% of total brain mass) in humans compared with other primates does not reflect an increased relative number of cortical neurons. The ratios between glial cells and neurons in the human brain structures are similar to those found in other primates, and their numbers of cells match those expected for a primate of human proportions. These findings challenge the common view that humans stand out from other primates in their brain composition and indicate that, with regard to numbers of neuronal and nonneuronal cells, the human brain is an isometrically scaled-up primate brain.},

abstract = {The relationship between behavioral state, discharge pattern, and discharge rate was investigated in 26 lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) units recorded in cats in the dark during waking (W), synchronized sleep (S), and desynchronized sleep (D). A distinctive state-dependent discharge pattern was the presence of stereotyped bursts of 2-7 spikes that occurred in 63\% of the units. These bursts were most frequent in S, much less frequent in D, and rarely occurred in W. Lack of association with discharge rate changes between states showed the bursting to be a true state-dependent phenomenon. A burst consisted of 2-7 spikes, with each successive interspike interval being longer than the preceding one; in the 200 ms prior to burst occurrence, discharge probability decreased markedly. This structure of burst organization suggested a model of generation wherein each burst was caused by a unitary event of varying intensity, perhaps a rebound following a hyperpolarization. Spectral and autocorrelational analyses showed bursts occurred rhythmically in three cells at a frequency of 3-4 Hz and in two cells at a frequency of 10-12 Hz, indicating a possible linkage with slow-wave generators. While the number of bursts in the various behavioral states was a state-dependent phenomena, other aspects of discharge pattern were shown to be rate dependent. To evaluate discharge pattern apart from the occurrence of bursts, a "primary event spike train" was formed; this consisted of individual spikes and the first spike of each burst. This analysis showed that, within S, the probability of burst occurrence was highest when the primary spike rate was low. Quantitative analyses showed that first-order pattern measures (the form of the interspike interval histogram, IH) were dependent on the mean interspike interval (ISI, the inverse of mean rate). This association explained 83-89\% of the variance in a power series approximation of IH form. Joint interval histograms (JIH) were used to evaluate the signature of bursts and of the form of the primary spike train. As with interval histograms, the main features of the form of the primary spike JIH were dependent on the primary spike rate. Thus, we concluded that first- and second-order discharge patterns of primary events were rate dependent and not state dependent. Our data are compatible with a model where in the absence of retinal input, the frequency of LGN primary spikes over behavioral state changes is largely determined by brain stem reticular formation input.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

abstract = {Several studies have shown that sensory contextual cues can reduce the interference observed during learning of opposing force fields. However, because each study examined a small set of cues, often in a unique paradigm, the relative efficacy of different sensory contextual cues is unclear. In the present study we quantify how seven contextual cues, some investigated previously and some novel, affect the formation and recall of motor memories. Subjects made movements in a velocity-dependent curl field, with direction varying randomly from trial to trial but always associated with a unique contextual cue. Linking field direction to the cursor or background color, or to peripheral visual motion cues, did not reduce interference. In contrast, the orientation of a visual object attached to the hand cursor significantly reduced interference, albeit by a small amount. When the fields were associated with movement in different locations in the workspace, a substantial reduction in interference was observed. We tested whether this reduction in interference was due to the different locations of the visual feedback (targets and cursor) or the movements (proprioceptive). When the fields were associated only with changes in visual display location (movements always made centrally) or only with changes in the movement location (visual feedback always displayed centrally), a substantial reduction in interference was observed. These results show that although some visual cues can lead to the formation and recall of distinct representations in motor memory, changes in spatial visual and proprioceptive states of the movement are far more effective than changes in simple visual contextual cues.},

abstract = {One can choose between action alternatives that have no apparent difference in their outcomes. Such voluntary action decisions are associated with widespread frontal-parietal activation, and a tendency to inhibit the repetition of a previous action. However, the mechanism of initiating voluntary actions and the functions of different brain regions during this process remains largely unknown. Here, we combine computational modeling and functional magnetic resonance imaging to test the selection and inhibition mechanisms that mediate trial-to-trial voluntary action decisions. We fitted an optimized accumulator model to behavioral responses in a finger-tapping task in which participants were instructed to make chosen actions or specified actions. Model parameters derived from each individual were then applied to estimate the expected accumulated metabolic activity (EAA) engaged in every single trial. The EAA was associated with blood oxygenation level-dependent responses in a decision work that was maximal in the supplementary motor area and the caudal anterior cingulate cortex, consistent with a competitive accumulation-to-threshold mechanism for action decision by these regions. Furthermore, specific inhibition of the previous action's accumulator was related to the suppression of response repetition. This action-specific inhibition correlated with the activity of the right inferior frontal gyrus, when the option to repeat existed. Our findings suggest that human voluntary action decisions are mediated by complementary processes of intentional selection and inhibition.},

Here we use event-related, source-localized MEG (ER-SAM) to evaluate the possibility that neural activity changes related to priming in occipital, temporal, and prefrontal cortex correspond to more temporally coordinated and synchronized activity, reflected in local increases in the amplitude of low-frequency activity fluctuations (i.e. evoked power) that are time-locked to stimulus onset. Subjects (N = 17) identified pictures of objects that were either novel or repeated during the session. Tests in two separate low-frequency bands (theta/alpha: 5-15 Hz; beta: 15-35 Hz) revealed increases in evoked power (5-15 Hz) for repeated stimuli in the right fusiform gyrus, with the earliest significant increases observed 100-200 ms after stimulus onset. Increases with stimulus repetition were also observed in striate/extrastriate cortex (15-35 Hz) by 200-300 ms post-stimulus, along with a trend for a similar pattern in right lateral prefrontal cortex (5-15 Hz). Our results suggest that experience-dependent reductions in neural activity may affect improved behavioral identification through more coordinated, synchronized activity at low frequencies, constituting a mechanism for more efficient neural processing with experience.},

abstract = {The hypothesis that the intracranial EEG has local structure and short-term non-stationarity is tested with a little-studied measure of non-linear phase coupling, the bicoherence in human subdural and deep temporal lobe probe data from 11 subjects during sleeping, waking and seizure states. This measure of cooperativity estimates the proportion of energy in every possible pair of frequency components, F1, F2 (from 1 to 50 Hz in this study), that satisfies the definition of quadratic phase coupling (phase of component at F3, which is F1 + F2, equals phase of F1 + phase of F2). Derived from the bispectrum, which segregates the non-Gaussian energy, auto-bicoherence uses the frequency components in one channel; cross-bicoherence uses one channel for F1 and F2 and another for F3. These higher order spectra are used in physical systems for detection of episodes of non-linearity and transients, for pattern recognition and robust classification, relatively immune to Gaussian components and low signal to noise ratios. Bicoherence is found not to be a fixed character of the EEG but quite local and unstable, in agreement with the hypothesis. Bicoherence can be quite different in adjacent segments as brief as 1.6 s as well as adjacent intracranial electrodes as close as 6.5 mm, even when the EEG looks similar. It can rise or fall steeply within millimeters. It is virtually absent in many analysis epochs of 17s duration. Other epochs show significant bicoherence with diverse form and distribution over the bifrequency plane. Isolated peaks, periodic peaks or rounded mountain ranges are either widely scattered or confined to one or a few parts of the plane. Bicoherence is generally an invisible feature: one cannot usually recognize the responsible form of non-linearity or any obvious correlate in the raw EEG. During stage II/III sleep overall mean bicoherence is generally higher than in the waking state. During seizures the diverse EEG patterns average a significant elevation in bicoherence but have a wide variance. Maximum bispectrum, maximum power spectrum, maximum and mean bicoherence, skewness and asymmetry all vary independently of each other. Cross-bicoherence is often intermediate between the two auto-bicoherence spectra but commonly resembles one of the two. Of the known factors that contribute to bicoherence, transient as distinct from ongoing wave forms can be more important in our data sets. This measure of non-linear higher moments is very sensitive to weak quadratic phase coupling; this can come from several kinds of waveforms. New methods are needed to evaluate their respective contributions. Utility of this descriptor cannot be claimed before more carefully defined and repeatable brain states are studied.},

abstract = {We present a mean-field model of the cortex that attempts to describe the gross changes in brain electrical activity for the cycles of natural sleep. We incorporate within the model two major sleep modulatory effects: slow changes in both synaptic efficiency and in neuron resting voltage caused by the ∼90-min cycling in acetylcholine, together with even slower changes in resting voltage caused by gradual elimination during sleep of somnogens (fatigue agents) such as adenosine. We argue that the change from slow-wave sleep (SWS) to rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep can be understood as a first-order phase transition from a low-firing, coherent state to a high-firing, desychronized cortical state. We show that the model predictions for changes in EEG power, spectral distribution, and correlation time at the SWS-to-REM transition are consistent not only with those observed in clinical recordings of a sleeping human subject, but also with the on-cortex EEG patterns recently reported by Destexhe et al. [J. Neurosci.19(11), (1999) 4595–4608] for the sleeping cat.},

abstract = {1. The cellular mechanisms by which neurons of the ferret perigeniculate nucleus (PGN) participate in the generation of spindle waves and slowed absence seizure-like oscillations were investigated with intracellular and extracellular recording techniques in geniculate slices maintained in vitro. 2. During spindle wave generation, PGN neurons generated repetitive (2-9 Hz) high frequency (up to 500 Hz) burst discharges mediated by the activation of a low threshold Ca2+ spike by the arrival of barrages of excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs). In most PGN cells at resting membrane potentials (-60 to -70 mV) spindle waves were associated with a progressive hyperpolarization that persisted as a prolonged after-hyperpolarization. 3. The EPSPs occurring in PGN cells were highly synchronized with burst firing in the neighbouring portion of the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (LGNd) and were intermixed with short duration inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs). After block of GABAergic receptors, the EPSPs occurring during the generation of spindle waves reversed polarity at around 0 mV. In addition, these EPSPs were completely blocked with the bath application of the non-NMDA receptor antagonist 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX), as was spindle wave generation in both the PGN and LGNd. 4. Slowing the intraspindle frequency to 2-4 Hz with pharmacological block of GABAA receptors resulted in a marked increase in the intensity of burst firing by PGN cells such that the number of action potentials per burst increased from a maximum of thirteen to a maximum of sixty. Block of GABAA receptors also resulted in a marked increase in the amplitude and duration of the EPSP barrages arriving from the relay laminae during generation of the slowed oscillation. 5. These findings indicate that spindle waves are generated in the ferret LGNd in vitro through an interaction between the GABAergic neurons of the PGN and relay neurons, such that burst firing in relay neurons activates a barrage of EPSPs and a subsequent low threshold Ca2+ spike in PGN cells. This activation of PGN neurons inhibits a substantial number of relay cells, a few of which rebound burst after this IPSP, thus starting the cycle again. Block of GABAA receptors results in a marked enhancement of activity in PGN cells through increased excitation from relay cells and disinhibition from neighbouring PGN cells. This increased activity in PGN neurons results in a markedly enhanced activation of GABAB receptors in relay neurons and the subsequent generation of paroxysmal activity that is similar to that associated with absence seizures.},

Saccades provide an excellent paradigm for this because many of them can be made in a very short time and the underlying neural pathways are relatively well-known. LATER (linear approach to threshold with ergodic rate) is a model originally devised to explain reaction time distributions in simple decision tasks. Recently, however it is being extended to increasingly more advanced tasks, including those with decision errors and those requiring voluntary control such as the antisaccade task and those where sequential decisions are required. The strength of this modeling approach lies in its detailed, quantitative predictions of behavior, yet LATER models still retain their conceptual simplicity that made LATER initially successful in explaining reaction times in simple decision tasks.},

abstract = {Thalamic ventrobasal (VB) relay neurons receive information via two major types of glutamatergic synapses, that is, from the medial lemniscus (lemniscal synapses) and primary somatosensory cortex (corticothalamic synapses). These two synapses influence and coordinate firing responses of VB neurons, but their precise operational mechanisms are not yet well understood. In this study, we compared the composition of glutamate receptors and synaptic properties of corticothalamic and lemniscal synapses. We found that the relative contribution of NMDA receptor-mediated excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) to non-NMDA receptor-mediated EPSCs was significantly greater in corticothalamic synapses than in lemniscal synapses. Furthermore, NMDA receptor 2B-containing NMDA receptor- and kainate receptor-mediated currents were observed only in corticothalamic synapses, but not in lemniscal synapses. EPSCs in corticothalamic synapses displayed the postsynaptic summation in a frequency-dependent manner, in which the summation of the NMDA receptor-mediated component was largely involved. The summation of kainate receptor-mediated currents also partially contributed to the postsynaptic summation in corticothalamic synapses. In contrast, the contribution of NMDA receptor-mediated currents to the postsynaptic summation of lemniscal EPSCs was relatively minor. Furthermore, our results indicated that the prominent NMDA receptor-mediated component in corticothalamic synapses was the key determinant for the late-persistent firing of VB neurons in response to corticothalamic stimuli. In lemniscal synapses, in contrast, the onset-transient firing in response to lemniscal stimuli was regulated mainly by AMPA receptors.},

@article{Lytton1997,
abstract = {In vivo intracellular recording from cat thalamus and cortex was performed during spontaneous spike-wave seizures characterized by synchronously firing cortical neurons correlated with the electroencephalogram. During these seizures, thalamic reticular (RE) neurons discharged with long spike bursts riding on a depolarization, whereas thalamocortical (TC) neurons were either entrained into the seizures (40\%) or were quiescent (60\%). During quiescence, TC neurons showed phasic inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs) that coincided with paroxysmal depolarizing shifts in the simultaneously recorded cortical neuron. Computer simulations of a reciprocally connected TC-RE pair showed two major modes of TC-RE interaction. In one mode, a mutual oscillation involved direct TC neuron excitation of the RE neuron leading to a burst that fed back an IPSP into the TC neuron, producing a low-threshold spike. In the other, quiescent mode, the TC neuron was subject to stronger coalescing IPSPs. Simulated cortical stimulation could trigger a transition between the two modes. This transition could go in either direction and was dependent on the precise timing of the input. The transition did not always follow the stimulation immediately. A larger, multicolumnar simulation was set up to assess the role of the TC-RE pair in the context of extensive divergence and convergence. The amount of TC neuron spiking generally correlated with the strength of total inhibitory input, but large variations in the amount of spiking could be seen. Evidence for mutual oscillation could be demonstrated by comparing TC neuron firing with that in reciprocally connected RE neurons. An additional mechanism for TC neuron quiescence was assessed with the use of a cooperative model of gamma-aminobutyric acid-B (GABA(B))-mediated responses. With this model, RE neurons receiving repeated strong excitatory input produced TC neuron quiescence due to burst-duration-associated augmentation of GABA(B) current. We predict the existence of spatial inhomogeneity in apparently generalized spike-wave seizures, involving a center-surround pattern. In the center, intense cortical and RE neuron activity would be associated with TC neuron quiescence. In the surround, less intense hyperpolarization of TC neurons would allow low-threshold spikes to occur. This surround, an "epileptic penumbra," would be the forefront of the expanding epileptic wave during the process of initial seizure generalization. Therapeutically, we would then predict that agents that reduce TC neuron activity would have a greater effect on seizure onset than on ongoing spike-wave seizures or other thalamic oscillations.},

abstract = {A new computer-assisted system for automatic interpretation of the awake electroencephalogram (EEG) was developed. First, all the items necessary for EEG interpretation were determined in accordance with the procedure that a qualified electroencephalographer (EEGer) goes through for the visual inspection of the background EEG activity, and then each item was defined quantitatively. For the automatic interpretation, specific EEG parameters were determined for each item so that they could fit the graded judgement of the item by the qualified EEGer as closely possible. These specific EEG parameters were actually calculated from periodograms obtained from the time series of EEG records of 14 patients with various neurological diseases. The automatic EEG interpretation system thus established was applied to the EEG data of these 14 subjects and to 3 additional EEGs, and the results were compared with those obtained through the visual interpretation by the EEGer. This automatic EEG interpretation was found to be in good agreement with the visual interpretation by the EEGer in the most EEG records. In contrast with the previous automatic analyses of EEG which were focussed on certain aspects of EEG such as the dominant rhythym, the present system is unique in its capability of providing an integrative interpretation of the spontaneous awake EEG by taking into account all its features except for paroxysmal abnormalities.},

abstract = {Barnacle muscle fibers subjected to constant current stimulation produce a variety of types of oscillatory behavior when the internal medium contains the Ca++ chelator EGTA. Oscillations are abolished if Ca++ is removed from the external medium, or if the K+ conductance is blocked. Available voltage-clamp data indicate that the cell's active conductance systems are exceptionally simple. Given the complexity of barnacle fiber voltage behavior, this seems paradoxical. This paper presents an analysis of the possible modes of behavior available to a system of two noninactivating conductance mechanisms, and indicates a good correspondence to the types of behavior exhibited by barnacle fiber. The differential equations of a simple equivalent circuit for the fiber are dealt with by means of some of the mathematical techniques of nonlinear mechanics. General features of the system are (a) a propensity to produce damped or sustained oscillations over a rather broad parameter range, and (b) considerable latitude in the shape of the oscillatory potentials. It is concluded that for cells subject to changeable parameters (either from cell to cell or with time during cellular activity), a system dominated by two noninactivating conductances can exhibit varied oscillatory and bistable behavior.},

abstract = {In this paper, we compare mean-field and neural-mass models of electrophysiological responses using Bayesian model comparison. In previous work, we presented a mean-field model of neuronal dynamics as observed with magnetoencephalography and electroencephalography. Unlike neural-mass models, which consider only the mean activity of neuronal populations, mean-field models track the distribution (e.g., mean and dispersion) of population activity. This can be important if the mean affects the dispersion or vice versa. Here, we introduce a dynamical causal model based on mean-field (i.e., population density) models of neuronal activity, and use it to assess the evidence for a coupling between the mean and dispersion of hidden neuronal states using observed electromagnetic responses. We used Bayesian model comparison to compare homologous mean-field and neural-mass models, asking whether empirical responses support a role for population variance in shaping neuronal dynamics. We used the mismatch negativity (MMN) and somatosensory evoked potentials (SEP) as representative neuronal responses in physiological and non-physiological paradigms respectively. Our main conclusion was that although neural-mass models may be sufficient for cognitive paradigms, there is clear evidence for an effect of dispersion at the high levels of depolarization evoked in SEP paradigms. This suggests that (i) the dispersion of neuronal states within populations generating evoked brain signals can be manifest in observed brain signals and that (ii) the evidence for their effects can be accessed with dynamic causal model comparison.},

abstract = {Although it is known that electroencephalographic (EEG) spindle oscillations are generated and maintained in the thalamus, the underlying mechanisms are still not clear. In this paper, a physiologically based continuum model is used to explore the role of the thalamus in generation of EEG rhythms, particularly spindle oscillations. Furthermore, local interneurons (LIs) which were not previously included in such modeling are studied. A previous continuum model is extended to incorporate LIs within relay nuclei and self-connections of the reticular (RE) nucleus into investigation of the roles and functions of groups of thalamic neurons. The isolated thalamus is analysed into five distinct classes of substructures. Analysis of the properties of waves generated, leads to the main results that: (1) an isolated RE nucleus cannot generate spindle oscillations, but it is essential to generation of spindle oscillations in cooperation with the relay cells; (2) the LIs can also generate spindle oscillations in conjunction with the relay cells; (3) the self-connection loop within the LI population and the one within the RE nucleus both make spindle oscillations easier to produce than in the absence of these connections; (4) the LIs have similar effects to the RE nucleus, except that they are purely inhibitory, whereas the latter has both direct inhibitory effects on relay cells, and indirect net excitatory effects by inhibiting LIs which inhibit relay cells, and (6) self-connections amongst the LIs have equivalent effects to self-connections within the RE nucleus.},

abstract = {The brain is widely assumed to be a paradigmatic example of a complex, self-organizing system. As such, it should exhibit the classic hallmarks of nonlinearity, multistability, and "nondiffusivity" (large coherent fluctuations). Surprisingly, at least at the very large scale of neocortical dynamics, there is little empirical evidence to support this, and hence most computational and methodological frameworks for healthy brain activity have proceeded very reasonably from a purely linear and diffusive perspective. By studying the temporal fluctuations of power in human resting-state electroencephalograms, we show that, although these simple properties may hold true at some temporal scales, there is strong evidence for bistability and nondiffusivity in key brain rhythms. Bistability is manifest as nonclassic bursting between high- and low-amplitude modes in the alpha rhythm. Nondiffusivity is expressed through the irregular appearance of high amplitude "extremal" events in beta rhythm power fluctuations. The statistical robustness of these observations was confirmed through comparison with Gaussian-rendered phase-randomized surrogate data. Although there is a good conceptual framework for understanding bistability in cortical dynamics, the implications of the extremal events challenge existing frameworks for understanding large-scale brain systems.},

Electroencephalography (EEG) is a non-invasive and relatively inexpensive method for assessing neurophysiological function that can be used to achieve this goal. EEG measures the electrical activity of large, synchronously firing populations of neurons in the brain with electrodes placed on the scalp. This unit outlines the basics of setting up an EEG experiment with human participants, including equipment, and a step-by-step guide to applying and preparing an electrode cap. Also included are support protocols for two event-related potential (ERP) paradigms, P50 suppression, and mismatch negativity (MMN), which are measures of early sensory processing. These paradigms can be used to assess the integrity of early sensory processing in normal individuals and clinical populations, such as individuals with schizophrenia. Curr. Protoc.

abstract = {A quantitative, physiology-based model of the ascending arousal system is developed, using continuum neuronal population modeling, which involves averaging properties such as firing rates across neurons in each population. The model includes the ventrolateral preoptic area (VLPO), where circadian and homeostatic drives enter the system, the monoaminergic and cholinergic nuclei of the ascending arousal system, and their interconnections. The human sleep-wake cycle is governed by the activities of these nuclei, which modulate the behavioral state of the brain via diffuse neuromodulatory projections. The model parameters are not free since they correspond to physiological observables. Approximate parameter bounds are obtained by requiring consistency with physiological and behavioral measures, and the model replicates the human sleep-wake cycle, with physiologically reasonable voltages and firing rates. Mutual inhibition between the wake-promoting monoaminergic group and sleep-promoting VLPO causes ;;flip-flop'' behavior, with most time spent in 2 stable steady states corresponding to wake and sleep, with transitions between them on a timescale of a few minutes. The model predicts hysteresis in the sleep-wake cycle, with a region of bistability of the wake and sleep states. Reducing the monoaminergic-VLPO mutual inhibition results in a smaller hysteresis loop. This makes the model more prone to wake-sleep transitions in both directions and makes the states less distinguishable, as in narcolepsy. The model behavior is robust across the constrained parameter ranges, but with sufficient flexibility to describe a wide range of observed phenomena.},

Investigators have recently identified axonal signals that recruit myelin-forming Schwann cells from an alternate fate of simple axonal engulfment. This is the evolutionary oldest form of axon-glia interaction, and its function is unknown. Recent observations suggest that oligodendrocytes and Schwann cells not only myelinate axons but also maintain their long-term functional integrity. Mutations in the mouse reveal that axonal support by oligodendrocytes is independent of myelin assembly. The underlying mechanisms are still poorly understood; we do know that to maintain axonal integrity, mammalian myelin-forming cells require the expression of some glia-specific proteins, including CNP, PLP, and MAG, as well as intact peroxisomes, none of which is necessary for myelin assembly. Loss of glial support causes progressive axon degeneration and possibly local inflammation, both of which are likely to contribute to a variety of neuronal diseases in the central and peripheral nervous systems.},

abstract = {In this paper, we investigate the dynamical scenarios of transitions between normal and paroxysmal state in epilepsy. We assume that some epileptic neural network are bistable i.e., they feature two operational states, ictal and interictal that co-exist. The transitions between these two states may occur according to a Poisson process, a random walk process or as a result of deterministic time-dependent mechanisms. We analyze data from animal models of absence epilepsy, human epilepsies and in vitro models. The distributions of durations of ictal and interictal epochs are fitted with a gamma distribution. On the basis of qualitative features of the fits, we identify the dynamical processes that may have generated the underlying data. The analysis showed that the following hold. 1) The dynamics of ictal epochs differ from those of interictal states. 2) Seizure initiation can be accounted for by a random walk process while seizure termination is often mediated by deterministic mechanisms. 3) In certain cases, the transitions between ictal and interictal states can be modeled by a Poisson process operating in a bistable network. These results imply that exact prediction of seizure occurrence is not possible but termination of an ictal state by appropriate counter stimulation might be feasible.},

abstract = {In this paper we propose that the dynamic evolution of EEG activity during epileptic seizures may be characterised as a path through parameter space of a neural mass model, reflecting gradual changes in underlying physiological mechanisms. Previous theoretical studies have shown how boundaries in parameter space of the model (so-called bifurcations) correspond to transitions in EEG waveforms between apparently normal, spike and wave and subsequently poly-spike and wave activity. In the present manuscript, we develop a multi-objective genetic algorithm that can estimate parameters of an underlying model from clinical data recordings. A standard approach to this problem is to transform both clinical data and model output into the frequency domain and then choose parameters that minimise the difference in their respective power spectra. Instead in the present manuscript, we estimate parameters in the time domain, their choice being determined according to the best fit obtained between the model output and specific features of the observed EEG waveform. This results in an approximate path through the bifurcation plane of the model obtained from clinical data. We present comparisons of such paths through parameter space from separate seizures from an individual subject, as well as between different subjects. Differences in the path reflect subtleties of variation in the dynamics of EEG, which at present appear indistinguishable using standard clinical techniques.},

abstract = {The hypothesis that nucleus reticularis thalami (RE) is the generator of spindle rhythmicity during electroencephalogram (EEG) synchronization was tested in acutely prepared cats. Unit discharges and focal waves were extracellularly recorded in the rostral pole of RE nucleus, which was completely disconnected by transections from all other thalamic nuclei. In some experiments, additional transections through corona radiata created a triangular island in which the rostral RE pole survived with the caudate nucleus, putamen, basal forebrain nuclei, prepyriform area, and the adjacent cortex. Similar results were obtained in two types of experiments: brain stem-transected preparations that exhibited spontaneous spindle sequences, and animals under ketamine anesthesia in which transient spindling was repeatedly precipitated during recording by very low doses of a short-acting barbiturate. Both spindle-related rhythms (7- to 16-Hz waves grouped in sequences that recur with a rhythm of 0.1-0.3 Hz) are seen in focal recordings of the deafferented RE nucleus. The presence of spindling rhythmicity in the disconnected RE nucleus contrasts with total absence of spindles in cortical EEG leads and in thalamic recordings behind the transection. Oscillations within the same frequency range as that of spontaneous spindles can be evoked in the deafferented RE nucleus by subcortical white matter stimulation. In deafferented RE cells, the burst structure consists of an initially biphasic acceleration-deceleration pattern, eventually leading to a long-lasting tonic tail. Quantitative group data show that the burst parameters of disconnected RE cells are very similar to those of RE neurons with intact connections. In the deafferented RE nucleus, spike bursts of RE neurons recur periodically (0.1-0.3 Hz) in close time-relation with simultaneously recorded focal spindle sequences. The burst occurrence of deafferented RE cells is greatly reduced after systemic administration of bicuculline. The preservation of both spindle-related rhythms in the disconnected RE nucleus, together with our recent experiments showing abolition of spindle oscillations in thalamic nuclei after lesions of RE nucleus (24), demonstrate that RE nucleus is the generator of spindle rhythms.},

abstract = {Objective The present study aims to accurately estimate the in vivo brain-to-skull conductivity ratio by means of cortical imaging technique. Simultaneous extra- and intra-cranial potential recordings induced by subdural current stimulation were analyzed to get the estimation. Methods The effective brain-to-skull conductivity ratio was estimated in vivo for 5 epilepsy patients. The estimation was performed using multi-channel simultaneously recorded scalp and cortical electrical potentials during subdural electrical stimulation. The cortical imaging technique was used to compute the inverse cortical potential distribution from the scalp recorded potentials using a 3-shell head volume conductor model. The brain-to-skull conductivity ratio, which leads to the most consistent cortical potential estimates with respect to the direct intra-cranial measurements, is considered to be the effective brain-to-skull conductivity ratio. Results The present estimation provided consistent results in 5 human subjects studied. The in vivo effective brain-to-skull conductivity ratio ranged from 18 to 34 in the 5 epilepsy patients. Conclusions The effective brain-to-skull conductivity ratio can be estimated from simultaneous intra- and extra-cranial potential recordings and the averaged value/standard deviation is 25±7. Significance The present results provide important experimental data on the brain-to-skull conductivity ratio, which is of significance for accurate brain source localization using piece-wise homogeneous head models.},

@article{Stam2005,
abstract = {Many complex and interesting phenomena in nature are due to nonlinear phenomena. The theory of nonlinear dynamical systems, also called 'chaos theory', has now progressed to a stage, where it becomes possible to study self-organization and pattern formation in the complex neuronal networks of the brain. One approach to nonlinear time series analysis consists of reconstructing, from time series of EEG or MEG, an attractor of the underlying dynamical system, and characterizing it in terms of its dimension (an estimate of the degrees of freedom of the system), or its Lyapunov exponents and entropy (reflecting unpredictability of the dynamics due to the sensitive dependence on initial conditions). More recently developed nonlinear measures characterize other features of local brain dynamics (forecasting, time asymmetry, determinism) or the nonlinear synchronization between recordings from different brain regions. Nonlinear time series has been applied to EEG and MEG of healthy subjects during no-task resting states, perceptual processing, performance of cognitive tasks and different sleep stages. Many pathologic states have been examined as well, ranging from toxic states, seizures, and psychiatric disorders to Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and Cre1utzfeldt-Jakob's disease. Interpretation of these results in terms of 'functional sources' and 'functional networks' allows the identification of three basic patterns of brain dynamics: (i) normal, ongoing dynamics during a no-task, resting state in healthy subjects; this state is characterized by a high dimensional complexity and a relatively low and fluctuating level of synchronization of the neuronal networks; (ii) hypersynchronous, highly nonlinear dynamics of epileptic seizures; (iii) dynamics of degenerative encephalopathies with an abnormally low level of between area synchronization. Only intermediate levels of rapidly fluctuating synchronization, possibly due to critical dynamics near a phase transition, are associated with normal information processing, whereas both hyper-as well as hyposynchronous states result in impaired information processing and disturbed consciousness.},

abstract = {The role of the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) of the thalamus in visual encoding remains an open question. Here, we characterize the function of tonic and burst spikes in cat LGN X-cells in signaling features of natural stimuli. A significant increase in bursting was observed during natural stimulation (relative to white noise stimulation) and was linked to the strong correlation structure of the natural scene movies. Burst responses were triggered by specific stimulus events consisting of a prolonged inhibitory stimulus, followed by an excitatory stimulus, such as the movement of an object into the receptive field. LGN responses to natural scene movies were predicted using an integrate-and-fire (IF) framework and compared with experimentally observed responses. The standard IF model successfully predicted LGN responses to natural scene movies during tonic firing, indicating a linear relationship between stimulus and response. However, the IF model typically underpredicted the LGN response during periods of bursting, indicating a nonlinear amplification of the stimulus in the actual response. The addition of a burst mechanism to the IF model was necessary to accurately predict the entire LGN response. These results suggest that LGN bursts are an important part of the neural code, providing a nonlinear amplification of stimulus features that are typical of the natural environment.},

Although the major contributor of the extracellular signal is the synaptic transmembrane current, other sources--including Na(+) and Ca(2+) spikes, ionic fluxes through voltage- and ligand-gated channels, and intrinsic membrane oscillations--can substantially shape the extracellular field. High-density recordings of field activity in animals and subdural grid recordings in humans, combined with recently developed data processing tools and computational modelling, can provide insight into the cooperative behaviour of neurons, their average synaptic input and their spiking output, and can increase our understanding of how these processes contribute to the extracellular signal.},

abstract = {The purpose of the present study was threefold: First, to replicate previous findings of changes in local gamma band power as a function of the complexity of a visuo-semantic processing task, second, to extend these findings in tasks delivered in the auditory modality, and third to explore the use of non-linear algorithms as indices of complexity and distant synchronization in the EEG signal. EEG was recorded from 28 scalp locations as participants performed three visual discrimination tasks designed to tap into increasingly more complex operations regularly involved in the recognition of living animate objects. Two auditory processing tasks involving the same stimuli, but requiring no semantic processing, served as controls. The degree of complexity of the semantic decision was associated with the predicted changes in local gamma power, as well as with broadband changes in the non-linear predictability of the signal (an index derived using an artificial neural network algorithm). These changes were observed at all scalp regions, a finding consistent with the wide cortical distribution of component processes involved in the tasks. In addition, the synchronization between temporal and parieto-occipital electrodes and the remaining recording sites was highest in the gamma bands and lowest in the alpha bands for the task that required the most complex visuo-semantic decision. This trend reversed with reduced task complexity, consistent with the view that multidimensional semantic decisions require the involvement of distributed cortical networks in auditory and visual association areas and in the frontal lobes.},

abstract = {It has been shown in previous studies on sleep electroencephalogram (EEG) that spindles are slower in the beginning of the night fastening towards the end of the night. Corresponding findings have been obtained by spectral analysis. The present study was based on our preliminary observation that slower spindles are found in the middle of the non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep episodes as compared with the beginning or the end of the episodes. Eight healthy female and six male subjects were studied. Sleep spindles were visually selected and spindle frequencies calculated for 11 analysis points in each NREM sleep episode. The median spindle frequencies formed a clear U-shape within NREM sleep episodes with an initial decrease and final increase. The decrease was statistically significant within the first four NREM sleep episodes. It is possible that the spindle frequency pattern could be used to reveal variations in sleep depth within sleep stage 2. In animal studies the spindle frequency has been found to be associated to the duration of the hyperpolarization-rebound sequences of the thalamocortical cells. If it is assumed that the same cellular mechanisms are responsible for spindle frequencies in humans then the study of variations in spindle frequency could be used to examine the NREM sleep process in humans.},

abstract = {We have previously shown that patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) perseverate in their choice of action relative to healthy controls, and that this is affected by dopaminergic medication (Hughes LE, Barker RA, Owen AM, Rowe JB. 2010. Parkinson's disease and healthy aging: Independent and interacting effects on action selection. Hum Brain Mapp. 31:1886-1899). To understand further the neural basis of these phenomena, we used a new task that manipulated the options to repeat responses. Seventeen patients with idiopathic PD were studied both "on" and "off" dopaminergic medication and 18 healthy adults were scanned twice as controls. All subjects performed a right-handed 3-choice button press task, which controlled the availability of repeatable responses. The frequency of choosing to repeat a response (a form of perseveration) in patients was related to dopamine therapy and disease severity as a "U-shaped" function. For repetitive trials, this "U-shaped" relationship was also reflected in the BOLD response in the caudate nuclei and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex. Our results support a U-shaped model of optimized cortico-striatal circuit function and clearly demonstrate that flexibility in response choice is modulated by an interaction of dopamine and disease severity.},

abstract = {We describe demographic, clinical, laboratory and aetiological findings in 93 consecutive patients with rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behaviour disorder (RBD), which consists of excessive motor activity during dreaming in association with loss of skeletal muscle atonia of REM sleep. The patients were seen at the Mayo Sleep Disorders Center between January 1, 1991 and July 31, 1995. Eighty-one patients (87\%) were male. The mean age of RBD onset was 60.9 years (range 36-84 years) and the mean age at presentation was 64.4 years (37-85 years). Thirty-two per cent of patients had injured themselves and 64\% had assaulted their spouses. Subdural haematomas occurred in two patients. Dream content was altered and involved defence of the sleeper against attack in 87\%. The frequency of nocturnal events decreased with time in seven untreated patients with neurodegenerative disease. MRI or CT head scans were performed in 56\% of patients. Although four scans showed brainstem pathology, all of these patients had apparently unrelated neurodegenerative diseases known to be associated with RBD. Neurological disorders were present in 57\% of patients; Parkinson's disease, dementia without parkinsonism and multiple system atrophy accounted for all but 14\% of these. RBD developed before parkinsonism in 52\% of the patients with Parkinson's disease. Five of the 14 patients with multiple system atrophy were female, and thus the strong male predominance in RBD is less evident in this condition. Psychiatric disorders, drug use or drug withdrawal were rarely causally related to RBD. Clonazepam treatment of RBD was completely or partially successful in 87\% of the patients who used the drug. We conclude that RBD is a well-defined condition and that descriptions from different centres are fairly consistent. It is commonest in elderly males and may result in serious morbidity to patients and bed partners. There is a strong relationship to neurodegenerative disease, especially Parkinson's disease, multiple system atrophy and dementia, and neurologists should explore the possibility of RBD in patients with these conditions. RBD symptoms may be the first manifestations of these disorders and careful follow-up is needed. Neuroimaging is unlikely to reveal underlying disorders not suspected clinically. We confirm the effectiveness of clonazepam, but note that attention to the safety of the bed environment may be sufficient for patients with contraindications to the drug.},

abstract = {Recent evidence indicates that net synaptic strength in cortical and other networks increases during wakefulness and returns to a baseline level during sleep. These homeostatic changes in synaptic strength are accompanied by corresponding changes in sleep slow wave activity (SWA) and in neuronal firing rates and synchrony. Other evidence indicates that sleep is associated with an initial reactivation of learned firing patterns that decreases over time. Finally, sleep can enhance performance of learned tasks, aid memory consolidation, and desaturate the ability to learn. Using a large-scale model of the corticothalamic system equipped with a spike-timing dependent learning rule, in agreement with experimental results, we demonstrate a net increase in synaptic strength in the waking mode associated with an increase in neuronal firing rates and synchrony. In the sleep mode, net synaptic strength decreases accompanied by a decline in SWA. We show that the interplay of activity and plasticity changes implements a control loop yielding an exponential, self-limiting renormalization of synaptic strength. Moreover, when the model "learns" a sequence of activation during waking, the learned sequence is preferentially reactivated during sleep, and reactivation declines over time. Finally, sleep-dependent synaptic renormalization leads to increased signal-to-noise ratios, increased resistance to interference, and desaturation of learning capabilities. Although the specific mechanisms implemented in the model cannot capture the variety and complexity of biological substrates, and will need modifications in line with future evidence, the present simulations provide a unified, parsimonious account for diverse experimental findings coming from molecular, electrophysiological, and behavioral approaches.},

abstract = {For patients with medically intractable epilepsy, there have been few effective alternatives to resective surgery, a destructive, irreversible treatment, A strategy receiving increased attention is using interictal spike patterns and continuous EEG measurements from epileptic patients to predict and ultimately control seizure activity via chemical or electrical control systems. This work compares results of seven linear and nonlinear methods (analysis of power spectra, cross-correlation, principal components, phase, wavelets, correlation integral, and mutual prediction) in detecting the earliest dynamical changes preceding 12 intracranially-re corded seizures from 4 patients. A method of counting standard deviations was used to compare across methods, and the earliest departures from thresholds determined from non-seizure EEG were compared to a neurologist's judgement. For these data, the nonlinear methods offered no predictive advantage over the linear methods. All the methods described here were successful in detecting changes leading to a seizure between one and two minutes before the first changes noted by the neurologist, although analysis of phase correlation proved the most robust. The success of phase analysis may be due in part to its complete insensitivity to amplitude, which may provide a significant source of error.},

abstract = {Physiological and/or pathological implications of the dynamics of sleep stage transitions have not, to date, been investigated. We report detailed duration and transition statistics between sleep stages in healthy subjects and in others with chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS); in addition, we also compare our data with previously published results for rats. Twenty-two healthy females and 22 female patients with CFS, characterized by complaints of unrefreshing sleep, underwent one night of polysomnographic recording. We find that duration of deep sleep (stages III and IV) follows a power-law probability distribution function; in contrast, stage II sleep durations follow a stretched exponential and stage I, and REM sleep durations follow an exponential function. These stage duration distributions show a gradually increasing departure from the exponential form with increasing depth of sleep toward a power-law type distribution for deep sleep, suggesting increasing complexity of regulation of deeper sleep stages. We also find a substantial number of REM to non-REM sleep transitions in humans, while this transition is reported to be virtually nonexistent in rats. The relative frequency of this REM to non-REM sleep transition is significantly lower in CFS patients than in controls, resulting in a significantly greater relative transition frequency of moving from both REM and stage I sleep to awake. Such an alteration in the transition pattern suggests that the normal continuation of sleep in light or REM sleep is disrupted in CFS. We conclude that dynamic transition analysis of sleep stages is useful for elucidating yet-to-be-determined human sleep regulation mechanisms with pathophysiological implications.},

abstract = {A physiologically based model of corticothalamic dynamics is used to investigate the electroencephalographic (EEG) activity associated with tumors of the thalamus. Tumor activity is modeled by introducing localized two-dimensional spatial non-uniformities into the model parameters, and calculating the resulting activity via the coupling of spatial eigenmodes. The model is able to reproduce various qualitative features typical of waking eyes-closed EEGs in the presence of a thalamic tumor, such as the appearance of abnormal peaks at theta ([approximate]3Hz) and spindle ([approximate]12Hz) frequencies, the attenuation of normal eyes-closed background rhythms, and the onset of epileptic activity, as well as the relatively normal EEGs often observed. The results indicate that the abnormal activity at theta and spindle frequencies arises when a small portion of the brain is forced into an over-inhibited state due to the tumor, in which there is an increase in the firing of (inhibitory) thalamic reticular neurons. The effect is heightened when there is a concurrent decrease in the firing of (excitatory) thalamic relay neurons, which are in any case inhibited by the reticular ones. This is likely due to a decrease in the responsiveness of the peritumoral region to cholinergic inputs from the brainstem, and a corresponding depolarization of thalamic reticular neurons, and hyperpolarization of thalamic relay neurons, similar to the mechanism active during slow-wave sleep. The results indicate that disruption of normal thalamic activity is essential to generate these spectral peaks. Furthermore, the present work indicates that high-voltage and epileptiform EEGs are caused by a tumor-induced local over-excitation of the thalamus, which propagates to the cortex. Experimental findings relating to local over-inhibition and over-excitation are discussed. It is also confirmed that increasing the size of the tumor leads to greater abnormalities in the observable EEG. The usefulness of EEG for localizing the tumor is investigated.},

abstract = {When a sensory stimulus repeats, neuronal firing rate and functional MRI blood oxygen level-dependent responses typically decline, yet perception and behavioral performance either stay constant or improve. An additional aspect of neuronal activity is neuronal synchronization, which can enhance the impact of neurons onto their postsynaptic targets independent of neuronal firing rates. We show that stimulus repetition leads to profound changes of neuronal gamma-band (∼40-90 Hz) synchronization. Electrocorticographic recordings in two awake macaque monkeys demonstrated that repeated presentations of a visual grating stimulus resulted in a steady increase of visually induced gamma-band activity in area V1, gamma-band synchronization between areas V1 and V4, and gamma-band activity in area V4. Microelectrode recordings in area V4 of two additional monkeys under the same stimulation conditions allowed a direct comparison of firing rates and gamma-band synchronization strengths for multiunit activity (MUA), as well as for isolated single units, sorted into putative pyramidal cells and putative interneurons. MUA and putative interneurons showed repetition-related decreases in firing rate, yet increases in gamma-band synchronization. Putative pyramidal cells showed no repetition-related firing rate change, but a decrease in gamma-band synchronization for weakly stimulus-driven units and constant gamma-band synchronization for strongly driven units. We propose that the repetition-related changes in gamma-band synchronization maintain the interareal stimulus signaling and sharpen the stimulus representation by gamma-synchronized pyramidal cell spikes.},

abstract = {Even in the simplest laboratory tasks older adults generally take more time to respond than young adults. One of the reasons for this age-related slowing is that older adults are reluctant to commit errors, a cautious attitude that prompts them to accumulate more information before making a decision (Rabbitt, 1979). This suggests that age-related slowing may be partly due to unwillingness on behalf of elderly participants to adopt a fast-but-careless setting when asked. We investigate the neuroanatomical and neurocognitive basis of age-related slowing in a perceptual decision-making task where cues instructed young and old participants to respond either quickly or accurately. Mathematical modeling of the behavioral data confirmed that cueing for speed encouraged participants to set low response thresholds, but this was more evident in younger than older participants. Diffusion weighted structural images suggest that the more cautious threshold settings of older participants may be due to a reduction of white matter integrity in corticostriatal tracts that connect the pre-SMA to the striatum. These results are consistent with the striatal account of the speed-accuracy tradeoff according to which an increased emphasis on response speed increases the cortical input to the striatum, resulting in global disinhibition of the cortex. Our findings suggest that the unwillingness of older adults to adopt fast speed-accuracy tradeoff settings may not just reflect a strategic choice that is entirely under voluntary control, but that it may also reflect structural limitations: age-related decrements in brain connectivity.},

We settled those and concluded that 3 min of monitoring are required to obtain reliable and reproducible bicoherence values.},

@article{Clemens2005,
abstract = {Despite strong evidence supporting a role for sleep in the consolidation of newly acquired declarative memories, the contribution of specific sleep stages remains controversial. Based on electrophysiological studies in animals, synchronous sleep oscillations have been long proposed as possible origins of sleep-related memory improvement. Nevertheless, no studies to date have directly investigated the impact of sleep oscillations on overnight memory retention in humans. In the present study we provide evidence that overnight verbal memory retention is highly correlated with the number of sleep spindles detected by an automatic algorithm over left frontocentral areas. At the same time, overnight retention of newly learned faces was found to be independent of spindle activity but correlated with non-rapid-eye-movement sleep time. The data strongly support theories suggesting a link between sleep spindle activity and verbal memory consolidation.},

@article{VanAlbada2010,
abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate age-associated changes in physiologically-based EEG spectral parameters in the healthy population. METHODS: Eyes-closed EEG spectra of 1498 healthy subjects aged 6-86 years were fitted to a mean-field model of thalamocortical dynamics in a cross-sectional study. Parameters were synaptodendritic rates, cortical wave decay rates, connection strengths (gains), axonal delays for thalamocortical loops, and power normalizations. Age trends were approximated using smooth asymptotically linear functions with a single turning point. We also considered sex differences and relationships between model parameters and traditional quantitative EEG measures. RESULTS: The cross-sectional data suggest that changes tend to be most rapid in childhood, generally leveling off at age 15-20 years. Most gains decrease in magnitude with age, as does power normalization. Axonal and dendritic delays decrease in childhood and then increase. Axonal delays and gains show small but significant sex differences. CONCLUSIONS: Mean-field brain modeling allows interpretation of age-associated EEG trends in terms of physiological processes, including the growth and regression of white matter, influencing axonal delays, and the establishment and pruning of synaptic connections, influencing gains. SIGNIFICANCE: This study demonstrates the feasibility of inverse modeling of EEG spectra as a noninvasive method for investigating large-scale corticothalamic dynamics, and provides a basis for future comparisons.},

@article{Lam2011,
abstract = {Most axons connecting the thalamus and cortex in both directions pass through the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN), a thin layer of GABAergic cells adjacent to the thalamus, and innervate neurons there. The TRN, therefore, is in a strategic location to regulate thalamocortical communication. We recorded neurons of the somatosensory region of the TRN in a thalamocortical slice preparation and studied the spatial organization of their thalamic input using laser scanning photostimulation. We show that the thalamoreticular pathway is organized topographically for most neurons. The somatosensory region of the TRN can be organized into three tiers. From the inner (thalamoreticular) border to the outer, in a manner roughly reciprocal to the reticulothalamic pathway, each of these tiers receives its input from one of the somatosensory relays of the thalamus--the posterior medial, ventroposterior medial, and ventroposterior lateral nuclei. What is surprising is that approximately a quarter of the recorded neurons received input from multiple thalamic regions usually located in different nuclei. These neurons distribute evenly throughout the thickness of the TRN. Our results, therefore, suggest that there exist a subpopulation of TRN neurons that receive convergent inputs from multiple thalamic sources and engage in more complex patterns of inhibition of relay cells. We propose these neurons enable the TRN to act as an externally driven "searchlight" that integrates cortical and subcortical inputs and then inhibits or disinhibits specific thalamic relay cells, so that appropriate information can get through the thalamus to the cortex.},
