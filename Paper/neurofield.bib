  abstract =      {The cortex is a complex system, characterized by its
                   dynamics and architecture, which underlie many
                   functions such as action, perception, learning,
                   language, and cognition. Its structural architecture
                   has been studied for more than a hundred years;
                   however, its dynamics have been addressed much less
                   thoroughly. In this paper, we review and integrate,
                   in a unifying framework, a variety of computational
                   approaches that have been used to characterize the
                   dynamics of the cortex, as evidenced at different
                   levels of measurement. Computational models at
                   different space-time scales help us understand the
                   fundamental mechanisms that underpin neural processes
                   and relate these processes to neuroscience data.
                   Modeling at the single neuron level is necessary
                   because this is the level at which information is
                   exchanged between the computing elements of the
                   brain; the neurons. Mesoscopic models tell us how
                   neural elements interact to yield emergent behavior
                   at the level of microcolumns and cortical columns.
                   Macroscopic models can inform us about whole brain
                   dynamics and interactions between large-scale neural
                   systems such as cortical regions, the thalamus, and
                   brain stem. Each level of description relates
                   uniquely to neuroscience data, from single-unit
                   recordings, through local field potentials to
                   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI),
                   electroencephalogram (EEG), and magnetoencephalogram
                   (MEG). Models of the cortex can establish which types
                   of large-scale neuronal networks can perform
                   computations and characterize their emergent
                   properties. Mean-field and related formulations of
                   dynamics also play an essential and complementary
                   role as forward models that can be inverted given
                   empirical data. This makes dynamic models critical in
                   integrating theory and experiments. We argue that
                   elaborating principled and informed models is a
                   prerequisite for grounding empirical neuroscience in
                   a cogent theoretical framework, commensurate with the
                   achievements in the physical sciences.},

  abstract =      {The aim of this paper is twofold: first, to introduce
                   a neural field model motivated by a well-known neural
                   mass model; second, to show how one can estimate
                   model parameters pertaining to spatial (anatomical)
                   properties of neuronal sources based on EEG or LFP
                   spectra using Bayesian inference. Specifically, we
                   consider neural field models of cortical activity as
                   generative models in the context of dynamic causal
                   modeling (DCM). This paper considers the simplest
                   case of a single cortical source modeled by the
                   spatiotemporal dynamics of hidden neuronal states on
                   a bounded cortical surface or manifold. We build this
                   model using multiple layers, corresponding to
                   cortical lamina in the real cortical manifold. These
                   layers correspond to the populations considered in
                   classical (Jansen and Rit) neural mass models. This
                   allows us to formulate a neural field model that can
                   be reduced to a neural mass model using appropriate
                   constraints on its spatial parameters. In turn, this
                   enables one to compare and contrast the predicted
                   responses from equivalent neural field and mass
                   models respectively. We pursue this using empirical
                   LFP data from a single electrode to show that the
                   parameters controlling the spatial dynamics of
                   cortical activity can be recovered, using DCM, even
                   in the absence of explicit spatial information in
                   observed data.},

  abstract =      {A central difficulty of brain modelling is to span
                   the range of spatio-temporal scales from synapses to
                   the whole brain. This paper overviews results from a
                   recent model of the generation of brain electrical
                   activity that incorporates both basic microscopic
                   neurophysiology and large-scale brain anatomy to
                   predict brain electrical activity at scales from a
                   few tenths of a millimetre to the whole brain. This
                   model incorporates synaptic and dendritic dynamics,
                   nonlinearity of the firing response, axonal
                   propagation and corticocortical and corticothalamic
                   pathways. Its relatively few parameters measure
                   quantities such as synaptic strengths,
                   corticothalamic delays, synaptic and dendritic time
                   constants, and axonal ranges, and are all constrained
                   by independent physiological measurements. It
                   reproduces quantitative forms of
                   electroencephalograms seen in various states of
                   arousal, evoked response potentials, coherence
                   functions, seizure dynamics and other phenomena.
                   Fitting model predictions to experimental data
                   enables underlying physiological parameters to be
                   inferred, giving a new non-invasive window into brain
                   function that complements slower, but
                   finer-resolution, techniques such as fMRI. Because
                   the parameters measure physiological quantities
                   relating to multiple scales, and probe deep
                   structures such as the thalamus, this will permit the
                   testing of a range of hypotheses about vigilance,
                   cognition, drug action and brain function. In
                   addition, referencing to a standardized database of
                   subjects adds strength and specificity to
                   characterizations obtained.},

                   physiologically-based EEG spectral parameters in the
                   healthy population. METHODS: Eyes-closed EEG spectra
                   of 1498 healthy subjects aged 6-86 years were fitted
                   to a mean-field model of thalamocortical dynamics in
                   a cross-sectional study. Parameters were
                   synaptodendritic rates, cortical wave decay rates,
                   connection strengths (gains), axonal delays for
                   thalamocortical loops, and power normalizations. Age
                   trends were approximated using smooth asymptotically
                   linear functions with a single turning point. We also
                   considered sex differences and relationships between
                   model parameters and traditional quantitative EEG
                   measures. RESULTS: The cross-sectional data suggest
                   that changes tend to be most rapid in childhood,
                   generally leveling off at age 15-20 years. Most gains
                   decrease in magnitude with age, as does power
                   normalization. Axonal and dendritic delays decrease
                   in childhood and then increase. Axonal delays and
                   gains show small but significant sex differences.
                   CONCLUSIONS: Mean-field brain modeling allows
                   interpretation of age-associated EEG trends in terms
                   of physiological processes, including the growth and
                   regression of white matter, influencing axonal
                   delays, and the establishment and pruning of synaptic
                   connections, influencing gains. SIGNIFICANCE: This
                   study demonstrates the feasibility of inverse
                   modeling of EEG spectra as a noninvasive method for
                   investigating large-scale corticothalamic dynamics,

                   impulse responses using a continuum model of brain
                   electrical activity. Previous models of ongoing brain
                   activity are refined by adding an improved model of
                   thalamic connectivity and modulation, and by allowing
                   for two populations of excitatory cortical neurons
                   distinguished by their axonal ranges. Evoked
                   potentials are shown to be modelable as an impulse
                   response that is a sum of component responses. The
                   component occurring about 100 ms poststimulus is
                   attributed to sensory activation, and this, together
                   with positive and negative feedback pathways between
                   the cortex and thalamus, results in subsequent peaks
                   and troughs that semiquantitatively reproduce those
                   of observed evoked potentials. Modulation of the
                   strengths of positive and negative feedback, in ways
                   consistent with psychological theories of attentional
                   focus, results in distinct responses resembling those
                   seen in experiments involving attentional changes.
                   The modeled impulse responses reproduce key features
                   of typical experimental evoked response potentials:
                   timing, relative amplitude, and number of peaks. The
                   same model, with further modulation of feedback, also
                   reproduces experimental spectra. Together, these
                   results mean that a broad range of ongoing and
                   transient electrocortical activity can be understood
                   within a common framework, which is parameterized by
                   values that are directly related to physiological and

  abstract =      {The aim of this paper is to explain critical features
                   of the human primary generalized epilepsies by
                   investigating the dynamical bifurcations of a
                   nonlinear model of the brain's mean field dynamics.
                   The model treats the cortex as a medium for the
                   propagation of waves of electrical activity,
                   incorporating key physiological processes such as
                   propagation delays, membrane physiology, and
                   corticothalamic feedback. Previous analyses have
                   demonstrated its descriptive validity in a wide range
                   of healthy states and yielded specific predictions
                   with regards to seizure phenomena. We show that
                   mapping the structure of the nonlinear bifurcation
                   set predicts a number of crucial dynamic processes,
                   including the onset of periodic and chaotic dynamics
                   as well as multistability. Quantitative study of
                   electrophysiological data supports the validity of
                   these predictions. Hence, we argue that the core
                   electrophysiological and cognitive differences
                   between tonic-clonic and absence seizures are
                   predicted and interrelated by the global bifurcation
                   diagram of the model's dynamics. The present study is
                   the first to present a unifying explanation of these
                   generalized seizures using the bifurcation analysis
                   of a dynamical model of the brain.},

                   but the underlying mechanisms for these phenomena are

                   reproduced by the dynamics of a quantitative neural
                   field model subject to periodic drive. Model power

                   agreement with multiple features of experimental
                   measurements, exhibiting nonlinear effects including

                   including period doubling, bistable phase-locking,
                   hysteresis, wave mixing, and chaos indicated by
                   positive Lyapunov exponents. Moreover, photosensitive

                   enabling interpretation of experimental data in terms

                   Nonlinearity in the thalamic relay nuclei gives rise

                   (EEG) are usually presented as coherence in
                   individual frequency bands. These coherences result
                   both from correlations among neocortical sources and
                   volume conduction through the tissues of the head.
                   The scalp EEG is spatially low-pass filtered by the
                   poorly conducting skull, introducing artificial
                   correlation between the electrodes. A four concentric

abstract = {A successful physiologically based continuum model of the corticothalamic system is applied to determine the relative contributions of axonal and intrinsic cellular delays to the waveforms of absence seizures. The predicted period of the absence seizure depends linearly on model parameters describing thalamocortical, corticothalamic, intracortical, and synaptodendritic delays, and these dependences are linked to the seizure mechanism by showing how time intervals between peaks in the waveforms depend on the parameters. Counterintuitively, it is found that a peak in the local field potential recorded in the thalamic relay nuclei can precede the peak in the cortical field that drove it, without violating causality, but rendering naive interpretation of time intervals between peaks invalid. We argue that a thalamocortical loop mechanism for absence seizures is consistent with intrathalamic cellular properties being the leading determinant of the frequency of spike-wave discharges in rat genetic models, with the combination of network and cellular properties providing a natural explanation for the lower frequency of human absence seizures. Finally, our results imply that the seizure frequency is not determined by the fastest thalamocortical and corticothalamic fibers, but rather depends on an effective weighted conduction velocity of all pathways present.},
